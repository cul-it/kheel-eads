         <p>The Southern Tenant Farmers' Union (STFU), a multi-racial union of
		  sharecroppers, tenant farmers and small landowners, was founded in Arkansas in
		  1934 by a group of socialists. Its operations extended throughout the South,
		  the Southwest, and California and came to include migrant farm workers, cannery
		  workers, rice and sugar mill workers and fishermen.</p>
         <p>Harry Leland Mitchell was a founding member and first executive
		  secretary of the Southern Tenant Farmers' Union from 1934 to 1939. During this
		  time, he was also an officer of the Socialist Party of Arkansas. After serving
		  as a consultant and special assistant to the National Youth Administration and
		  as an organizer for the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, Mitchell
		  was re-elected secretary of the STFU from 1941 to 1944 and served as president
		  of its successor, the National Farm Labor Union. During the 1950's, Mitchell
		  served on Dept. of Labor Committees and participated in various international
		  labor activities, as well as helping to form the AFL-CIO's Agricultural
		  Workers' Organizing Committee. During the 1960's, Mitchell continued to
		  organize southern agricultural workers, as well as rice and sugar mill workers
		  and fishermen. He also helped to found the Southern Mutual Help Association,
		  Inc. of Louisiana (1969) and the Southern Rural Welfare Association (1971).</p>
         <p>Thomas H. Gibbins was employed for many years by Western Union
		  Telegraph Company and other concerns in Kansas City. In the early 1930's, he
		  turned to farming and continued in that occupation until drought conditions
		  forced him to move to California, where he held various jobs. From 1950 until
		  1965, he served as caretaker at the Children's Home Society of California.</p>
         <p>During the Depression, Clyde L. Johnson was an activist in the
		  National Student League. In Georgia, he organized unemployed and WPA workers,
		  as well as farmers. As a member of the Communist Party, Johnson organized
		  workers in the steel and coal industries of Alabama. In 1935, he became
		  secretary of the Alabama Share Croppers Union and later served on the Southern
		  Organizing Committee of the National Farmers' Union. He also held various posts
		  in the United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing and Allied Workers of America, the
		  Oil Workers Organizing Committee, the Newspaper Guild, the United Electrical
		  Workers, and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners. Since 1966, he
		  has worked as a consultant and writer on labor.</p>
         <p>During the 1940's, David S. Burgess served as Minister to Agricultural
		  Labor for the United Church of Christ and worked with the Southern Tenant
		  Farmers' Union among agricultural migrants, tenant farmers and small farmers in
		  the South. In 1947, Burgess worked as an organizer for the Textile Workers'
		  Union of America. In 1949, he became southern representative for the CIO
		  Political Action Committee and, during the 1950's, served as executive
		  secretary of the Georgia CIO Council. From 1955 to 1960, Burgess was the
		  American labor attache in India. In the 1960's and '70's, he held various
		  administrative posts in the Peace Corps and UNICEF.</p>
