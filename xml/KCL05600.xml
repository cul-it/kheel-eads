			<p>The Northern Pacific Railroad Company [NP] was a transcontinental railroad that
				operated across the northern part of the continental United States from Minnesota to
				the Puget Sound. It was organized in 1864 with a charter by the United States
				Congress signed by President Abraham Lincoln. Construction in both Minnesota and
				Washington Territory (now Washington State) began in 1870. The lines were joined in
				western Montana in 1883, where former president Ulysses S. Grant drove in the golden
				spike. The railroad was fully completed in 1888 when a tunnel under the Cascade
				Mountains was completed, replacing a series of switchbacks over Stampede Pass that
				had been used as a temporary measure to transverse the natural barrier. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The NP was headquartered in St. Paul Minnesota, and its trackage and operations were
				organized into regional divisions. These regions changed over time (see Northern
				Pacific Railway Historical Association's <extref href="http://research.nprha.org/NP%20Division%20Maps/NP%20Division%20Evolution.pdf"> "NP Division Evolution"</extref>) as the
				railroad expanded its operations. The Minnesota Division, later called the St. Paul
				Division, was predominantly the area stretching from the Great Lakes to the
				Minnesota - North Dakota border. The main routes were St. Paul to Staples,
				Minnesota; St. Paul to White Bear Lake; and Staples to Dilworth, Minnesota. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Although this collection is from the Minnesota Division, there are reports from other
				divisions, such as Fargo, Dakota and Yellowstone, in the correspondence and claims
				files. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The NP was famous for its passenger service from Chicago to Seattle on the North
				Coast Limited train. It was also a major transporter of freight across the northern
				United States. In addition to providing access to newly opened lands, the NP also
				aided in their settlement by white Europeans, opening colonization offices in
				Germany and the Scandinavian countries, where they attracted immigrants with cheap
				but productive farmland, whose goods were then transported on NP trains. These
				populations settled primarily in Minnesota and the Dakota territories. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The NP also hired large numbers of Chinese laborers, mostly from the southern
				provinces around Hong Kong, though some may have been previously employed in the
				building of the Central Pacific Railroad. It is estimated by BNSF, the NP's
				successor railroad, that 15,000 of the 25,000 required laborers needed in 1882
				(<extref href="http://www.bnsf.com/about-bnsf/our-railroad/company-history/overview/#/32"> source</extref>)were Chinese immigrants. However
				unlike their German and Scandinavian counterparts, there are minimal records about
				these employees. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In addition to its key role in the westward expansion of the United States, the NP
				was also an innovator in technology, pioneering locomotive designs such as the
				4-8-4, called the Northern, and the 2-8-8-4, called the Yellowstone. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1970, NP merged with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad and the Great
				Northern Railway to form the Burlington Northern Railroad Company. In 1996, the
				Burlinton Norther merged with the Santa Fe Railway to form the Burlington Northern
				and Santa Fe Railway [BNSF], one of the largest freight railroads in the United
				States, and as of 2007 one of seven remaining North American Class I railroads.</p>

			<p>This collection consists of records from the Northern Pacific Railroad Company,
				Minnesota division. The majority of records present in the collection are concerned
				with employees and labor relations, although there are also records documenting the
				daily operations of the train yards. Of note in this regard are the Caboose Reports
				(1941-1945) written by superintendent T. M. Flynn, which document the assignment of
				cabooses, i.e. if they were in service, out of service, serviceable, or
				unserviceable. Also of note is the correspondence regarding efficiency tests and
				operating risks and rules by trainmasters and superintendents. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The labor records include a letter press book (1904-1909) of certificates of
				examination for positions of conductor and locomotive engineer on the Minnesota
				Division of the Northern Pacific Railway; a letter press book (1903-1907)
				documenting and recording dismissals and resignations of Northern Pacific Railway
				employees at Minneapolis, as well as the reason why employment has been terminated;
				and a series of monthly reports from 1945 that document employees leaving the
				company. Also of note is a ruling from the United States Railroad Administration,
				Railway Board of Adjustment No. 1, regarding yard work on Sundays. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The majority of the labor records consist of claims cases brought before the Train
				Service Board of Adjustment for the Western Region involving the Brotherhood of
				Locomotive Engineers [BLE] and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen
				[BLF&amp;E] vs. the Northern Pacific Railway (1929-1934) regarding
				seniority, runaround, wages, additional mileage, overtime, work schedule, reporting
				pay, deadhead payment, deadhead mileage, pay rates (local and freight), work
				assignments, pay for time lost, and pay for work performed outside of position
				description. Other claims cases heard by the Train Service Board of Adjustment for
				the Western Region involve the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen [BRT] and the Order
				of Railway Conductors and Brakemen [ORC] vs. the Northern Pacific Railroad Company
				(1925-1933) regarding wage rates, mileage, overtime, deadheading, pay for work
				performed outside of position description; and time claims, with attached letters
				from E.J. Hackenberg (superintendent) regarding the dispute resolutions, decisions,
				claims, and contract rules. There is a general synopsis of many of these cases,
				summarizing decision nos. 2601-4200. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The correspondence folders are arranged chronologically. The case decision folders
				are organized by decision number.</p>
