            <p>March 12, 1908-September 5, 2003 Milton Konvitz, a Cornell University faculty member
                and authority on constitutional and labor law, and civil and human rights, died
                Sept. 5 at the age of 95. Konvitz was a founding faculty member in the School of
                Industrial and Labor Relations from 1946 until his retirement in 1973. He was also a
                professor in Cornell's Law School. Konvitz is perhaps best known for his American
                Ideals course, which he taught to more than 8,000 students over the course of his
                career, never giving the same lecture twice. "I saw the U.S. Constitution as it has
                been interpreted as a magnificent depository of our ideals, both individual and
                social," he said. His course exposed students to the great intellectual thinkers and
                philosophers throughout history whose writings had shaped those ideals. They
                included Sophocles, whose play Antigone is Cornell's New Student Reading Project
                this year. One student he influenced was U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader
                Ginsburg, Cornell Class of 1954, who considers him a mentor. At Cornell Konvitz also
                was a founder of the university's Department of Near Eastern Studies and Program of
                Jewish Studies. "I felt it was essential for a college interested in the humanities
                not to leave out Hebrew language and literature," he said. "And the knowledge of
                Jewish history, which began 4,000 years ago and has contributed to civilization no
                less than Greek, Roman or English history, is important to today's students-Jewish
                and non-Jewish." He often hosted students at his Ithaca home and helped start the
                first Kosher dining option at Cornell, Young Israel House. In addition, for nearly
                30 years he directed the Liberian Codification Project, which drew up the official
                body of statutory laws that is still in force in the Republic of Liberia today,
                despite the current political upheaval there. Konvitz also edited the opinions of
                Liberia's Supreme Court and received the Grand Band of the Order of the Star of
                Africa, the highest award given to foreigners, as well as an honorary degree from
                the University of Liberia, one of seven honorary degrees he received in his
                lifetime. Active as a scholar and writer until his death, he wrote books and
                articles on American constitutional law that won him wide recognition and were cited
                in U.S. Supreme Court opinions. Among his nine books is Fundamental Liberties of a
                Free People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly, which was republished earlier this
                year with an expanded introduction by him that is strongly critical of the Rehnquist
                Supreme Court. Other books include A Century of Civil Rights (1983) and Judaism and
                Human Rights (2nd ed. 2001). He also edited a dozen volumes, including two on
                American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose thinking shaped his views. One
                Emersonian idea he absorbed was that readers give life to books, which Konvitz
                recast as follows: "It is in their hearing that students bring life to the words,
                the thoughts, the teacher." Konvitz was born in Safed, Palestine (now Israel ), in
                1908, the son of a rabbi. He immigrated to the United States in 1915 and became a
                naturalized citizen in 1926. He received a bachelor's degree in 1929 and a law
                degree in 1930, both from New York University, and a Ph.D. in philosophy from
                Cornell in 1933. Before joining Cornell's faculty, he was one of three assistant
                general counsels to Thurgood Marshall at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund for three
                years. He is survived by his wife, Mary, of Oakhurst, N.J.; a brother, Phillip, of
                Elberon, N.J.; a son and daughter-in-law, Josef and Isa, of Paris, France; and two
                grandsons, Eli and Ezra. Josef Konvitz, who grew up in Ithaca, is now an official at
                the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p>
