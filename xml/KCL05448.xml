			<p>The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes [BMWE] was organized by workers
				responsible for the physical condition of operational railway rights of way. The
				BMWE membership consisted of workers who built and maintained the tracks, bridges,
				buildings, and other railroad structures. It was founded in Alabama in 1887 as the
				Order of Railroad Trackmen by John T. Wilson. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1892, the Order merged with the Brotherhood of Railway Section Foremen of North
				America, a related organization, to form the Brotherhood of Railway Track Foremen of
				America. In 1896, the membership of the union was opened to white track laborers as
				well as foremen, and the organization became known as the Brotherhood of Railway
				Trackmen of America. In 1918, the Trackmen reintegrated a secessionist faction that
				had existed as a separate group since 1914 and became known as the United
				Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees and Railway Shop Laborers. The union
				adopted its current name in 1925 as part of an effort to settle jurisdictional
				problems with other American Federation of Labor unions. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 2004, the BMWE merged with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and renamed
				themselves the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division of the
				International Brotherhood of Teamsters [BMWED] to reflect the change in their
				organizational affiliation.</p>

				individual members' grievances. Also found in this collection are Members and Dues
				Books that list the names, ages, years of work experience, and union certificate
				numbers of local members. Additionally, the minutes of meeting in which the Lodge
				discussed how to support the widow of a deceased member and a certificate of
				membership signed by John T. Wilson are located in this collection.</p>
