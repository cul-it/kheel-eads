			<p>The Northern Pacific Railway Company [NP] built the Staples Station in 1909. It was
				designed by the same architectural firm, Reed and Stem, which designed the NP's King
				Street Station in Seattle, Washington and New York's Grand Central Terminal. The
				Staples depot and freight house were added to the National Register of Historic
				Places in 1985. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The Staples Station served as a division point for the NP. As such, in additon to the
				passenger areas in the depot, the building housed office space for the trainmaster,
				superintendant, and other NP personnel who were responsible for overseeing NP
				operations in the neighboring train yards. The yards included a freight house, a round
				house, and repair in place tracks. Serving as a division point also meant that the
				Staples Station was where train crews would start and end their shifts, or even use
				overnight facilities provided for employees. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Due to its position as a division point, the correspondence of the trainmaster A. W.
				McClelland covers a wide variety of topics related to running a well-functioning
				train yard and station.</p>

			<p> </p>
			<p>This collection consists of the correspondence of Austin W. McClelland, the
				trainmaster for the Northern Pacific Railway Company's Staples Station in Staples,
				Minnesota. The correspondence dates from 1918. There are three pieces of
				correspondence that are not from this year, one letter from 1925 and two reports
				from 1931. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The correpsondence offers an intimate view into the daily operations of a train yard.
				The telegrams and letters cover everything from reporting trains running late, to
				repairs made to trains in the yard, to personal thanks from passengers, to freight
				bills, to disciplinary notices, and to employees asking for days off or telegraphing
				out sick. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Of note is a piece of correspondence from W. G. McAdoo, director general of
				railroads, dated March 22, 1918 regarding the nationalization of all railroads as
				part of the war mobilization. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The correspondence is arranged chronologically.</p>
