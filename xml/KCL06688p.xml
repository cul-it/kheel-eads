						<p>Gelatin silver print, [before 1898]. Image depicts the Merrimack River in the Belvidere section of Lowell, Mass., just below Stackpole Street and East Merrimack Street. Taken from the Belvidere side of the river; Stackpole and East
							Merrimack Sts. would be off to the left. The Centralville (Bridge Street) bridge is seen in the distance, and some of the mill chimneys beyond it. What is now the Hunts Falls Bridge has not yet been built. Trees are nearly bare;

						<p>Gelatin silver print, [before 1898]. Image depicts the Northern Canal (on the left) running parallel to the Merrimack River (on the right) in Lowell, Mass. An ironwork bridge (what is now the School Street Bridge) is barely visible

							Pawtucketville, clustered around the Mammoth Road area. The bell tower in the center background is probably the Pawtucket Congregational Church; this building was replaced with a red brick Romanesque building in 1898. 24.25 x 17.25
							cm.</p>
