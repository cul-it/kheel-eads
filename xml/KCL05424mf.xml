            <p>Frank Gilbreth was born in Fairfield, Maine in 1868, to John Hiram and Martha (nee
                Bunker) Gilbreth, and had no formal education beyond high school. </p>
            <p>At age 3, his father passed away, it was after this that his family moved to Boston,
                Massachusetts. He became a bricklayer apprentice after high school, which led to him
                becoming a building contractor, an inventor with several patents and lastly a
                management engineer. He also became an occasional lecturer at Purdue University,
                where his papers are housed. Gilbreth married Lillian Evelyn Moller on October 19,
                1904 in Oakland, California; they had 12 children, 11 of whom survived him. </p>
            <p>As a result of Gilbreth trying to make his bricklaying job faster and easier, he and
                his wife, Lillian Moller Gilbreth, came up with an idea to study the work habits of
                manufacturing and clerical employees in all sorts of industries. They worked to find
                ways to increase output and make the jobs easier. They founded a management
                consulting firm, Gilbreth, Inc. </p>
            <p>Gilbreth served in the U.S. Army during World War I. He was charged with finding
                quicker and more efficient means of assembling and disassembling small arms.
                According to Claude George (1968), Gilbreth reduced all motions of the hand into
                some combination of 17 basic motions. These included grasp, transport loaded, and
                hold. Gilbreth named the motions therbligs, "Gilbreth" spelled backwards with the th
                transposed. He used a motion picture camera that was calibrated in fractions of
                minutes to time the smallest of motions in workers. </p>
            <p>According to George the Gilbreths were, most of all, scientists who sought to teach
                management that all parts of the workplace should be constantly questioned, and
                continuely updated. Their emphasis on the 'one best way' and the therbligs predates
                the development of continuous quality improvement (CQI), and the understanding that
                repeated motions can lead to workers experiencing repetitive motion injuries. </p>

            <p>Gilbreth was a first with many of his ideas, such as positioning a 'caddy' for
                surgeons instruments, so they could be handed them more efficiently and easily. He
                also devised a standard technique for armies to train their recruits how to rapidly
                disassemble and reassemble their weapons even when blindfolded or in total darkness. </p>
            <p>Gilbreth died of a heart attack on June 14, 1924, at age 55, his wife Lillian
                outlived him by 48 years.</p>
