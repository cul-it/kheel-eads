   <p>The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) was founded at a world labor conference in London,
    England in 1945. Its stated goal was the development of better understanding and joint programs
    among the national unions of various countries. The WFTU soon came under the control of
    affiliated communist unions. Communist domination of the WFTU resulted in the disaffiliation of
    the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in 1949. The CIO then joined with other labor
    organizations opposed to the politics of the WFTU to form the International Confederation of
    Free Trade Unions.</p>
  </bioghist>
  <scopecontent encodinganalog="MARC 520">
   
   <p>Records consist primarily of the minutes, proceedings and reports of WFTU officers and
    governance committees, produced and presented at WFTU conferences held in London (1945, 1949);
    Paris (1945, 1947, 1949); Moscow (1946, 1970); Trieste (1946); Prague (1947, 1958, 1963, 1967);
    Geneva (1948); Rome (1948); Peking (1949); Budapest (1950, 1969, 1972); Bucharest (1950, 1971);
    Berlin (1951, 1958); Vienna (1951-1953); Warsaw (1954, 1959); Sofia (1956, 1966); Nicosia
    (1966); Khartoum (1970); and Varna (1973). Also include some personal correspondence and WFTU
    materials collected by Adolf F. Germer (socialist; official and organizer of the Congress of
    Industrial Organizations (CIO) and various coal and petroleum workers' unions) during his
    attendance as the CIO delegate to the WFTU conference (Prague, 1946), and his membership on the
    WFTU Committee on German Affairs (1947). </p>
   <p>Governance records (1945-1973) include minutes, resolutions and proceedings of the WFTU
    Executive Bureau, General Councils, and committees (1945-1973) and of joint meetings of the WFTU
    and International Trade Secretariats (1948); also financial statements of the WFTU (1945-1949). </p>
   <p>Reports and publications (1946-1973) consist mainly of unpublished reports and some pamphlets
    produced and presented at the annual sessions of the Executive Bureau and General Councils of
    the WFTU; also reports pertaining to special policies and activities of the WFTU. Materials
    pertaining to the WFTU's internal organization discuss or document the creation of WFTU
    international trade departments and negotiations between WFTU and International Trade
    Secretariats (1947-1948); establishment of WFTU departments on professionals, metal trades
    workers, miners, textile workers, and agricultural and forestry workers (1946-1964); charter of
    union rights (1954); and various revisions and amendments to the WFTU constitution (1948-1970).
    Also include documents regarding relations between the WFTU and the United Nations,
    International Labour Organization, Congress of Industrial Organizations, American Federation of
    Labor, and Allied Commission (Berlin); and various conferences, including the Pan Asiatic Trade
    Union Conference, the Pan Africa Conference, and the World Trade Union Congress (1948-1973). </p>
   <p>Also, WFTU policy statements regarding union activity and socioeconomic conditions in Spain,
    Iran, Egypt, South Africa, Greece, Occupied Germany and various colonial countries (1946);
    activities in Trieste, Tunisia, Iran, Japan, Austria, the international coal countries, Greece
    and Portugal (1947-1948); in Burma, Italy, Israel, and Japan (1949-1952); and in the European
    coal and steel community, Vietnam, colonial and newly independent countries, and Palestine
    (1953-1965). </p>
   <p>Additional reports (some of which were produced by WFTU officers Louis Saillant, Leon Jouhaux,
    S. Rostovsky, Fernando Santi and R. Vivimari) regard WFTU policy on: professional workers,
    migrations, postwar reconstruction and grants-in-aid, equal work and equal wages for women
    workers, and union rights (1946-1948); racial discrimination, currency devaluations, the
    international labor movement, and the WFTU delegation to Israel (1949-1950); social security,
    struggles for political and union rights for international workers (1951-1952); atomic war and
    peace, women workers and young workers (1953-1958); and the European Economic Community and
    monopolies, protection of victims of anti-union repression, and general WFTU activities
    (1959-1966); also, international union relations, unions and scientific and technical progress,
    unity among unions, monetary crises, economic and social demands of workers in capitalist </p>
   <p> countries, and union education (1967-1973). </p>
   <p>Additional documents collected by Adolf F. Germer (CIO delegate to the WFTU) include various
    bulletins and press releases of the U.S. military government in Germany; pamphlets and reports
    pertaining to the trade union movement, social welfare, women workers, and political issues in
    Czechoslovakia (1945-1947); and press releases and publications of the Freier Deutscher
    Gewerkschaftsbund. </p>
   <p>Also, a file of correspondence between Germer and various WFTU leaders, American union leaders
    and politicians. Correspondents include Philip Murray (president, CIO); Louis Saillant (general
    secretary, WFTU); William Green (president, American Federation of Labor); Wayne Morse (U.S.
    senator) and Leon Blum (prime minister of France). The correspondence generally pertains to WFTU
    conferences, publications, development of international unionism, and relations between unions
    and the WFTU (1944-1947).</p>
