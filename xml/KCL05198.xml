            <p>Francis J. Reilly worked for the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway
                as a brakeman in the Kankakee, Illinois Yard. In 1952, he was dismissed from service
                for failure to appear for his work assignment on October 6, 1952. Mr. Reilly
                contended that he had asked for time off because of a personal emergency, and that
                even though he was not granted the time off, he had no choice but not to appear for
                work. In an investigation, he was given a deferred thirty-day suspension on his
                record. Mr. Reilly did not think this was reasonable, and began to seek a way to
                appeal the decision. When a second hearing regarding his conduct was held, Mr.
                Reilly neglected to attend. As a result, his employment was terminated. He then
                filed a petition with the NRAB, which dismissed his case. When the Railway Labor Act
                was amended in 1966 to allow petitioners to appeal NRAB decisions, Mr. Reilly took
                the opportunity to appeal his decision. The courts dismissed his claims and his
                final appeal to the Supreme Court was not granted.</p>

            <p>The National Railroad Adjustment Board [NRAB] was created by <extref href="http://https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/45/153">45 U.S. Code 153</extref>. It is overseen by the National
                Mediation Board, which was created by the 1934 amendment to Railway Labor Act to
                oversee the arbitration of labor disputes in the railway and airline industries. The
                NRAB is tasked with arbitrating minor disputes, i.e. grievance arbitrations, in the
                railway industry. It has four divisions, each division having jurisdiction over
                specific classes of employees. The First Division has "jurisdiction over disputes
                involving train- and yard-service employees of carriers; that is, engineers,
                firemen, hostlers, and outside hostler helpers, conductors, trainmen, and
                yard-service employees." It has eight members, four selected by the carriers and
                four selected by the labor organizations.</p>

            <p>This collection consist of four published volumes of decision from the First
                Division, National Railroad Adjustment Board [NRAB] and papers from legal filings
                donated by Francis J. Reilly, a brakeman for the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and
                St. Louis Railway. The four volumes contain the decisions made by the NRAB from May
                1967 to December 1968. The legal filings and supplementary materials contain the
                original petition for reinstatement filed by Mr. Reilly in front of the NRAB in
                1955, the NRAB's dismissal of his petition (Award 17167), supplementary materials
                collected by Mr. Reilly concerning his case, his filing in the U.S. District Court
                for the Eastern District of Illinois in 1968 asking for the court to overturn the
                NRAB's decision, and the subsequent appeals he filed after his petitions were
                dismissed by the courts. These records contain annotations from Mr. Reilly,
                explaining his reasoning in pursuing this case as well as offering his criticism
                when the decisions were not favorable. Also found in this collection are various
                newspaper clippings about the Supreme Court, the backlog of cases waiting for
                hearings, and reports from labor publications on the railroad industry.</p>
