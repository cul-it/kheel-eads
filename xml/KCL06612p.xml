   <head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
   <p>This collection consists mostly of prints from the glass plate negatives in collection 6612 GPN: Draper Corporation Glass Plate Negatives. Collection 6612 GPN consists of two series: Series A, 5 inch by 7 inch glass plate negatives, approximately 1,500;
    and Series B, 8 inch by 10 inch glass plate negatives, approximately 2,000. </p>
   <p>Many of the photographs in Series A depict company outings, or "Field Days." These events were most likely organized by the Draper Company and may have consisted entirely of Draper Company employees. Founders of the Draper Company, brothers George and
    Ebenezer Draper were responsible for creating an integrated, planned community with innovative employee housing and recreational spaces, in addition to employment. </p>
   <p>Series B consists largely of machinery built by the Draper Company. Also included are photographs of the company plant, employee housing, recreational facilities, and the surrounding area. </p>
   <p>All negatives in collection 6612 GPN have been printed and included in this collection. Of the roughly 3,500 negatives 513 have been described at the individual level. Those descriptions are available in the container lists for both this collection and
    collection 6612 GPN. </p>
   <p>In addition to the photographs from 6612 GPN, other photographs of Draper Corporation machinery, buildings, employees, and executives are included in this collection.</p>

   <p>The container list for this collection is not complete. Only those photographs that had descriptions from the American Textile History Museum are included as "Items." The photograph number has been used as the "item number" in order to allow for
    descriptions for the currently undescribed photographs to be added with any re-numbering.</p>

       no box for the bobbins. The harness is the frame containing the heddles through which the warp threads are drawn prior to weaving. By lifting or lowering the harnesses in the loom the shed is formed. The shed is the opening formed when some warp threads
       are raised by their harnesses while others are left down. Forming the shed is the first action in weaving, and it is through the shed that the shuttle passes in inserting the filling. This loom contains two harnesses. The C model loom was Draper's first
       heavy pattern loom and was obsolete by 1900. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. 25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

       the cloth as it is woven. The speed with which it performs this action determines the number of picks per inch. A worm gear take-up motion is continuous, as opposed to the intermittent motion. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily
       looms. 25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

       shuttle box, across the race plate, into the opposite shuttle box.) The F model loom was designed for an extra heavy pattern for goods 72 inches and wider. A notation on the back of the print reads: "F Model Loom Feb 1900." See Item 48, in this folder,

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.A1000. 1891-1895. Image depicts the male employees of the Temple Shop at the Draper Company in Hopedale, Massachusetts A dozen men, some in work clothes, and two in suits, stand in the Temple Shop, among
       equipment including lathes. A temple is a device on a loom located near the fell of the cloth, one on each side; temples hold the cloth out as wide as possible during the process of weaving and prevent it from being drawn in too much by the filling. See
       Item 994, in this folder, for a view of the Temple Shop without employees and taken from the opposite angle as this one. The Temple Shop was built in 1868 for W. W. Dutcher, a three-story brick factory on Social Street. The Draper Company manufactured
       textile machinery, primarily looms. 25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

       front of that is a platform on which a number of workers can be seen. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. See Item 1029, in this folder, for a closer view of the damage at the base of the chimney and Item 1030 and Item
       1032, in this folder, for close-up views of the interior damage. See Box 1, Folder 5, Item 1003 for an image of the chimney, much taller than here, under construction. 20.5 x 25.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.A1029. 1891-1895. Image depicts the rubble at the base of a wrecked chimney at the Draper Company, which most likely occurred during the construction phase. The scaffolding surrounding the chimney is
       damaged. The engine room below it is also damaged with the partial collapse of a wall and a portion of the roof. Debris from the scaffolding and bricks litter the remaining roof and yard below the chimney. See Item 1028, in this folder, for a broader
       angle of the chimney collapse. See item 1030 and Item 1031, in this folder, for close-ups of the interior damage. 25 x 20.5 cm.</p>

       the other end of the street seen in Item 1056, in this folder. Original photograph by the Draper Company. 20.25 x 25.25 cm.</p>

       and, again, has at least three chimneys. The last house on the right has two entrances and two chimneys. These four homes consist of two different styles, but within each style there are a few differences. A few other houses are partially visible in the

       1000 for a view of the Temple Shop with a dozen employees and taken from the opposite angle as this one. The Temple Shop was built in 1868 for W. W. Dutcher. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. See Box 1, Folder 5, Item

       head-on. "Draper Company" is embossed on the piece on the floor, leaning against the machine. A twister is a machine for twisting together two or more separate ends, making either a ply yarn or a cable yarn, or for inserting additional twist in a single
       end. It is made with either a pin creel or beam creel; in this case, a pin creel, which can be seen on the top of the twister. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. 20.25 x 25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.A161. 1901-1916. Image depicts three different houses on Bancroft Parkway in Hopedale. All are substantial, wood-shingled, two-and-a-half story residences. The house on the right (which can be partially
       seen on the far left of Item 157, in this folder) has two chimneys, two gable windows in the uppermost story, and two entrances on the wide front porch. The house in the center has at least three chimneys, and several gables, all with Tudor-style wood
       motifs. It too has a wide front porch with two entrances. The house on the left most likely has two entrances, although only one can be seen, and has a steeply sloping back roof. An open area of grass is in the foreground; apparently only one side of
       the street contains residences. These houses were built for Draper Company employees. 25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

       gambrel style and has two entrances. The house next to it on the right is a more conventional Colonial in style with two gable windows. The house on the far right has an entrance off a driveway or alley and appears to be quite large. All the houses have
       shutters at all the windows (some of them are closed). The street is unpaved and the right-hand side of the street is an open field. These houses were built for Draper Company employees. 25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

       several gables, a round tower on the left, and a very tall flagpole rising from the roof (there is no flag visible). The gables and windows are outlined with light stone. There is a grassy area in front of the school and several young trees have been
       planted. A short stretch of Dutcher Street is visible in the right foreground; it is unpaved but there is a sidewalk. Original photograph by the Draper Company. 25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.A173. 1901-1916. Image depicts a view of two houses on Bancroft Parkway in Hopedale, Massachusetts The house on the left is a substantial two-and-a-half-story wood-shingled residence, with two entrances on
       the front porch. A walkway leads to a set of steps at the rear of the house as well. All the windows have shutters. This house is probably the one that appears in Item 176, in this folder. The house on the right is not quite as large and in a different
       style, but is also most likely a duplex, as Hopedale housing built for Draper Company employees was not generally larger than a duplex. This house is also two-and-a-half stories and is wood-shingled; it does not, however, have shutters which is unusual
       for Draper Company housing (possibly the house is not quite finished). The two houses appear to be bisected by another road on which there are more houses as glimpses of two other houses can be seen behind the house on the left. The road is wide and
       unpaved; one electric pole stands at the side of the road. See Box 2, Folder 3, Item 182 for another view of these houses. These houses were built for Draper Company employees. 25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

       houses, all duplexes. See Item 173, in this folder, for a view of this house from the opposite angle, which does not show the houses down the street. The road is wide and unpaved; it appears quite rutted, which suggests that the neighborhood was not yet

       background is not quite as large and in a different style, but is also most likely a duplex, as Hopedale housing built for Draper Company employees was not generally larger than a duplex. This house is also two-and-a-half stories and is wood-shingled;
       it does not, however, have shutters which is unusual for Draper Company housing (possibly the house is not quite finished). The house on the left features two gables and has three chimneys. This house is most likely on a dirt road that can barely be
       discerned; see Box 2, Folder 2, Item 173 for a closer view of two of these houses. The road is wide and unpaved; one electric pole stands at the side of the road. These houses were built for Draper Company employees. 25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.A183. 1901-1916. Image depicts a view of the back yards of the houses on Bancroft Parkway in Hopedale, Massachusetts Substantial two-story wood-shingled houses line the unpaved road on both sides. Most of
       the houses have two chimneys and are most likely duplexes, as Hopedale housing for Draper employees was generally not larger than a duplex. The unpaved road is quite narrow and each house has a free-standing clothesline in the yard (several have laundry
       hanging from them}. Note the trash cans at the end of each walk leading from the houses. These houses were built for Draper Company employees. See Box 2, Folder 2, Item 166 for another view of back yards on Bancroft Parkway. 25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.A184. 1901-1916. Image depicts a view of a row of houses on Bancroft Parkway in Hopedale, Massachusetts All are substantial, two-and-a-half-story wood-shingled houses done in different architectural styles.
       The houses on the left-hand side of the street have trees and bushes planted and there is a paved sidewalk on that side of the street; those houses may have been constructed before the right-hand side of the street. The sidewalk on the right-hand side
       of the street is still dirt and there are no trees or bushes. A fire hydrant is on the street, which is wide and unpaved. These houses were built for Draper Company employees. See Box 2, Folder 2, Item 177 for a view of the same section of the street
       taken from the opposite end, showing more of the houses on what is the left-hand side of the street here. 25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

     <scopecontent>
      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.A186. 1903- 1906. Image depicts a four-story wooden boarding house. The building has three chimneys visible from this angle and a lightning rod. Shutters have been installed at some of the windows, but the
       far left side appears to be still under construction. No windows or shutters have been installed on that side, and there are two ladders leaning against the porch roof. (Notes in the accession folder indicate the boardinghouse was "doubled" which may
       account for the unfinished aspects of it.) A front porch runs the length of the building. The sign "Hopedale House," which can be seen in Box 3, Folder 2, Item 343 and Item 344 has not yet been installed, all of which suggests a date closer to 1903 than
       1905, the date for both Box 3, Folder 2, Item 343 and Item 344. A fire escape is visible on the right-hand end of the building. Note the laundry hanging on lines in the back yard on the right. A few bare trees are visible, possibly just planted.
       Founders of the Draper Company, brothers George and Ebenezer Draper were responsible for creating the integrated, planned community of Hopedale with innovative employee housing and recreational spaces, in addition to employment. See also Box 3, Folder
       2, Item 344 for another view of Hopedale House. 25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

     <scopecontent>
      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.A188. ca. 1900. Image depicts a view of the Adin Ballou house in Hopedale, Massachusetts, a two-story wooden clapboard building with two brick chimneys and shutters on some of the windows. A one-story
       extension of the house is at the back (or the back portion of the house was constructed as one story). There is a picket fence running parallel to the sidewalk from one side of the house. Ballou (1803-1890) was a prominent proponent of pacifism,
       socialism and abolitionism, and the founder (in 1842) of the Hopedale Community, a utopian community blending a factory town with a religious-based commune. See Item 199, in this folder, for a view of the house taken from the opposite angle. The house
       was located at the corner of Peace and Hopedale streets until it was moved to Dutcher Street in 1900; see Box 12, Folder 1, Item 2266 for a view of the house in 1919. Original photograph by the Draper Company. 25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.A198. 1903-1906. Image depicts a bronze marker placed at the corner of an unknown street and Dutcher Street. The marker reads: "Upton 4 1/2 miles" at the top and " This Street Presented to the Town of
       Hopedale by William F. Draper [date illegible]" at the base. Upton, Massachusetts, is a town located northwest of Hopedale. Dutcher Street is probably the larger, unpaved street on the right, on which several houses and electric poles are located. A low
       stone wall marks the street corner behind the marker. William Draper was associated with the Draper Company, the founders of which created the integrated, planned community of Hopedale with innovative employee housing and recreational spaces, in
       addition to employment. Original photograph by the Draper Company. 20.25 x 25 cm.</p>

       fences off to the right. Two houses can be seen in the left background. A four-story house (possibly a boardinghouse?) can be seen in the right foreground with wood trim decorative elements, shutters at every window, and an open front porch. Several
       wooden poles are on the edges of the street, but they have not yet been connected as either electric or telegraph poles (the pole closest to the boardinghouse is an electric pole, connected to the boardinghouse). It is possible this image was taken

       piece extends with a curved wall and attached bench. Flanking each end is an urn on a pedestal with an eagle seated at its base. A set of four marble steps descends to the lawn below. Sibyl was sculpted in 1903 by Waldo Story. The Bancroft library was
       donated to the town in 1898 by Joseph Bancroft, a Draper Company executive, in memory of his wife, Sylvia. The building was designed by Boston architect C. Howard Walker. It is constructed of Milford granite, and was modeled after Merton College Chapel

       piece extends with a curved wall and attached bench. Flanking each end is an urn on a pedestal with an eagle seated at its base. A set of four marble steps descends to the lawn below. Sibyl was sculpted in 1903 by Waldo Story. The Bancroft library was
       donated to the town in 1898 by Joseph Bancroft, a Draper Company executive, in memory of his wife, Sylvia. The building was designed by Boston architect C. Howard Walker. It is constructed of Milford granite, and was modeled after Merton College Chapel
       at Oxford. See Item 316, in this folder, for a virtually identical image. See Box 12, Folder 3, Item 77, Item 78, and Box 3, Folder 2, Item 352 for broader views of the library building. Original photograph by the Draper Company. 25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

       opposed to the wooden housing found in Hopedale, Massachusetts The houses are believed to have been designed by Peabody &amp; Stearns. See Box 2, Folder 1, Item 119 for what appears to be another view of these same units, and Box 3, Folder 1, Item 336

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.A351. May 31, 1906. Image depicts a three-story stone building situated on a street corner. The building was designed by architect Fred Swasey of Milford and built in 1886; it appears to be in the
       Romanesque style, somewhat similar to that of H. H. Richardson. The building has two chimneys and a gabled roof with decorative ironwork running along the upper edge. There are three entrances at the front; two women and one man pose in front of the
       entrance between windows that read "Post Office." Another man leans against the building in one of the other entrances. A horse-drawn cart or wagon is partially in view on the street on the left; "Hopedale" is printed on the top edge of the cart. See
       also Box 12, Folder 4, Item 160. Original photograph by the Draper Company. 25 x 20.5 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.A920. August 9, 1919. Image depicts a number of young girls participating in a potato race, most likely as part of a "Field Day" organized by the Draper Corporation for Draper Corporation employees. There
       is a line of boxes on the ground in the left foreground; the object is probably for your team to fill your box with potatoes and whichever box is filled first get the prize. A crowd of spectators watches in the background. It does not appear as if the
       girls were using spoons to carry the potatoes, as seen in Item 918, but it is unclear. The men on the left in the straw hats are probably monitoring the boxes. See also Item 919, in this folder. 25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

       court, while one leaps into the air to hit an overhand shot in the near court. The fourth player is not visible but may be in the backcourt on the right out of the photographer's range. A number of spectators line the court in the background. See also

       general idea is presumably to be the first to get your potato to the boxes on the far left and whichever box is filled first wins the race. A crowd of spectators watches in the background. This does not appear to be the same race as the girls' potato
       race, shown in Item 919 and Item 920, in this folder. See also Item 918, in this folder. 25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.A1553. 1910-1920? taken of an older image, ca. 1865. Image shows a distant view of various houses, Adin Ballou's Universalist Church in the right center, and shops on Mill River in the far left background.
       Note the octagon house in the center, with a cupola on the roof. This house most likely no longer existed by the time the glass plate negative was made in the early 20th century. Original photograph from glass plate negative by the Draper Company. 25 x
       20.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B2202. 1918-1919. Image depicts a close-up view of the Whitin-Owen feeler motion attached to a (presumably) Draper Corporation loom. A feeler is a device on a loom designed to transfer a full bobbin to the
       shuttle before the old one is entirely emptied. The feeler projects into the shuttle from the side and feels the yarn on the bobbin. When the bobbin is approaching emptiness, the feeler actuates the transfer motion and replaces the bobbin. The
       Whitin-Owen feeler motion was manufactured by the Whitin Machine Works of Whitinsville, Massachusetts The Draper Corporation manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. 20.25 x 25.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B2204. December 10, 1918. Image depicts a portrait of James Northrup (1856-1940), inventor of the Northrup Loom. He is pictured sporting a moustache and is dressed in suit and tie. The Draper Corporation
       produced the Northrup Loom, named for its inventor, who had emigrated from Keighley, Yorkshire, England in 1881. Northrup invented the first fully automatic loom, its basic feature being the filling-changing battery. Northrup looms were first marketed
       by Draper in 1894. Nothrup retired to California at the age of 42; as he appears to be in his late fifties or early sixties in this portrait, it is most likely a photograph of another photograph. 20.25 x 25.25 cm.</p>

       original photo may have been done for advertising purposes. The "Atlantic Mill" referred to on the reverse of the print is probably the Atlantic Cotton Mills in Lawrence, Massachusetts, which were cotton mills. The Atlantic Mills were idle by 1913 and
       dismantled in March 1915. This loom may be been used in or at least sold to the Atlantic Cotton Mills by Draper, which was located in Hopedale, Massachusetts 25.25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B2246. July 1, 1919. Image depicts a close-up of a sliding feeler for cops. A feeler is a device on a loom designed to transfer a full bobbin to the shuttle before the old one is entirely emptied. The
       feeler projects into the shuttle from the side and feels the yarn on the bobbin. When the bobbin is approaching emptiness, the feeler actuates the transfer motion and replaces the bobbin. A cop is a yarn package. The Draper Corporation manufactured
       textile machinery, primarily looms. 25.25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B2266. September 1919. Image depicts the Adin Ballou House on Dutcher Street in Hopedale, Massachusetts The house is a two-story wooden house with two chimneys, and both front and back doors. A wrap-around
       porch and set of steps join the front entry with a walkway to the sidewalk and street. Shrubs and climbing vines surround the porch and house. Ballou (1803-1890) was a prominent proponent of pacifism, socialism and abolitionism, and the founder (in
       1842) of the Hopedale Community, a utopian community blending a factory town with a religious-based commune. George and Ebenezer Draper withdrew their 75% of the community stock in 1856 to establish the Hopedale Manufacturing Company. Ballou continued
       on as Universalist pastor until retirement in 1880. The house was moved from its original location in 1900 to Dutcher Street and the porch added to the building. See Box 2, Folder 3, Item 188 and Item 199 for views of the house in its original location
       at Peace and Hopedale streets. Original photograph by the Draper Corporation. 25.25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

       although the one-story building on the right with the striped awnings may be the office. There is a one-story wooden clapboard building with a tower in the center left; in the background are several three- and four-story brick buildings, all part of the
       Draper Company complex. The sign on the pole in front of the wooden clapboard building reads: "Private Property. Do No Drive In. Very Dangerous." The wooden clapboard building is at a junction of Hopedale and another street, both unpaved. A set of

       of which are connected by a covered walkway (seen in the center of the photo). Hopedale Street and the street perpendicular to it in the foreground are both unpaved but have sidewalks. Several trees line Hopedale Street. See Item 151, in this folder,
       for the buildings that appear to the right of what is shown in this image (including the edge of the house on the right). Original photograph by the Draper Company. 25.25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B151. May 9, 1903. Image depicts a view of the west side of Hopedale Street in Hopedale, Massachusetts, showing a residential house on the left, and what may be a barn building of some sort on the right. In
       the background on the far right is a brick building that is part of the Draper Company complex. Attached to the barn building is a tall tower with a bell at the top; this may be the old fire tower referred to in the caption on the reverse of the print.
       In the foreground is some open area with grass and bushes; Hopedale Street is lined with trees. See Item 150, in this folder, for a view of the buildings to the left of what is shown in this image. Original photograph by the Draper Company. 25.25 x

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B154. Image depicts a single-story stone building with an arched doorway and windows. The library was donated to the town in 1898 by Joseph Bancroft, a Draper Company executive, in memory of his wife,
       Sylvia. The building was designed by Boston architect C. Howard Walker. It is constructed of Milford granite, and was modeled after Merton College Chapel at Oxford. The marble sculptures and fountain seen in Box 3, Folder 2, Item 352 have apparently not
       yet been added. See Box 3, Folder 1, Item 317 for a view of the fountain; see Box 12, Folder 3, Item 77 and Item 78, and Box 3, Folder 2, Item 342 and Item 352 for other views of the library. Original photograph by the Draper Company. 25.25 x 20.25

       horse-drawn wagon has been backed up to the door and is loaded with goods; another horse-drawn wagon carrying barrels is in the center of the image. The store was located on the west side of Hopedale Street; the front view of the store would be to the
       left, outside this image. The Henry L. Patrick store was established in 1869 and was a general country store, stocking all sorts of goods and commodities. The building was torn down in 1966. Original photograph by the Draper Company. 25.25 x 20.25

       background is a small, one-story building that is probably the railroad depot. Railroad cars can be seen behind it. To the left is a horse-drawn carriage and two other horses probably hooked to wagons. What appears to be smoke in the air is probably
       from a railroad engine. In the foreground (on the east side of Hopedale Street) is grass and several trees. Original photograph by the Draper Company. 25.25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B160. May 12, 1903. Image depicts a three-story stone building situated on the corner of Hopedale Street (in front of the building) and another, unknown street on the right. The building was designed by
       architect Fred Swasey of Milford and built in 1886; note the cornerstone with the phrase "anno domini" and the date in Roman numerals. The building appears to be in the Romanesque style, somewhat similar to that of H. H. Richardson. The building has two
       chimneys and a gabled roof with decorative ironwork running along the upper edge. There are three entrances at the front, one of which is to the post office (note the two windows labeled "Post Office") and another to the left to another business. The
       curved archway is probably the entrance to the town hall itself. See also Box 3, Folder 2, Item 351. Original photograph by the Draper Company. 25.25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

       if it is the side street on which a number of houses are visible. These houses are substantial two-story wood clapboard buildings; another two-story wood clapboard house is on the right side of the side street. Some open ground or lawn separates that

       left; it appears to be an extension of the porch. The house is set back from Hopedale Street (in the foreground) behind a row of bushes and some lawn. Two trees flank Hopedale Street in front of the house. This is the house in which Charles and Lura Day
       lived; she was the daughter of Joseph and Sylvia Bancroft. The lot was owned by F. M. Day in the 1890s and was on the corner of Hopedale and Hope streets. Hope Street would be to the right, beyond the edge of the image. The house stands opposite the
       Bancroft Memorial Library, which was built in 1898. Original photograph by the Draper Company. 25.25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

       the two sets of steps in the front). The house beyond it is smaller and may be a single family. Beyond that house is a series of connected townhouses, probably multi-family. All are wood clapboard buildings. All have large expansive lawns in front
       bordering on the street. A dog lays on the lawn in the center foreground. These houses were most likely constructed for Draper Company employees. Founders of the Draper Company, brothers George and Ebenezer Draper were responsible for creating an
       integrated, planned community with innovative employee housing and recreational spaces and events, in addition to employment. See Item 189, in this folder, for a view of the side of the house on the right. Original photograph by the Draper Company.

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B189. June 1, 1903. Image depicts a view of the side of a house on the east side of Dutcher Street in Hopedale, Massachusetts The house is a two-and-a-half story wood clapboard building with shutters on all
       the windows. The porch in the front (on the left) is covered with ivy or a climbing vine. An expansive lawn surrounds the house; a freestanding clothesline is in the side yard, in front of a much smaller house or storage building. A dog lays on the lawn
       in the center. Dutcher Street would be on the left, out of sight in this image. This house was most likely constructed for Draper Company employees. Founders of the Draper Company, brothers George and Ebenezer Draper were responsible for creating an
       integrated, planned community with innovative employee housing and recreational spaces and events, in addition to employment. See Item 188, in this folder, for a view of this house and others on Dutcher Street (and the dog). Original photograph by the
       Draper Company. 25.25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B190. Image depicts a line of houses in Prospect Heights, Milford, Massachusetts The first in the line is a series of connected townhouses, with eight total entrances. The next house appears to be detached
       (there are two small children in front of it), and then a second set of connected townhouses, with a detached house beyond that, etc. These are two-story brick buildings designed to accommodate multiple families. These buildings feature Tudor-style
       timbering in the gables on the end building, roofed entrances (some single, some double), and shutters at all the windows (some closed). There are small lawns in front between the houses and the street. Open space is in the foreground. Prospect Heights
       was built as housing for Draper Company employees, but most houses in Prospect Heights were brick, as opposed to the wooden housing found in Hopedale, Massachusetts The houses are believed to have been designed by Peabody &amp; Stearns. See Box 3,
       Folder 1, Item 340 for a closer view of the end houses. 25.25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B193. May 11, 1903. Image depicts a row of connected townhouses in Prospect Heights, Milford, Massachusetts, with a total of six entrances. These are two-story brick buildings designed to accommodate
       multiple families. These buildings feature roofed entrances and shutters at all the windows (some closed). There are small lawns in front between the houses and the street. Open space is in the foreground. While it would appear that this view is of the
       front of these houses, the two clotheslines filled with laundry across the road suggest this may actually be a rear view of these buildings. Another clothesline filled with laundry can be seen between two buildings on the left. Prospect Heights was
       built as housing for Draper Company employees, but most houses in Prospect Heights were brick, as opposed to the wooden housing found in Hopedale, Massachusetts The houses are believed to have been designed by Peabody &amp; Stearns. Founders of the

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B194. August 28, 1903. Image depicts a street of substantial two-story, wood-shingled houses. The house in the center right has a porch on the side and is probably a two-family, with an entrance on the
       other side of the house as well. The second house from the left is also a two-family with two entrances. Most of these houses are most likely two-family residences. All of the houses have shutters on the windows and lawns with some trees and bushes
       planted in front of them. The street, which curves around the houses, is unpaved but there is a sidewalk. These houses were constructed for employees of the Draper Company. Founders of the Draper Company, brothers George and Ebenezer Draper were

       likely a duplex. The house to the left, which is somewhat hidden by trees, is a wood-shingled duplex with two entrances. (This house can also be seen in Item 169.) The unpaved road is wide and curves around between the two houses. Electric poles have
       been erected along the side of the street; a fire hydrant is also visible. These houses were built for Draper Company employees. See also Box 2, Folder 2, Item 155. 25.25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B861. February 11, 1911. Image depicts an unidentified male operative demonstrating how mill operatives would suck the thread through the eye of a shuttle. The man holds the shuttle to his mouth; he would
       use his right hand to draw the thread out. Mill operatives would draw the thread through their mouths to help smooth it and make it easier to draw through the eye of the shuttle. However, sucking on cotton thread could eventually cause lung problems and
       did so in many mill operatives. The unidentified man wears work clothes: dark shirt and pants with a light tie. He also wears wire-rimmed glasses. The demonstration takes place in an unidentified mill; the battery of a loom can be seen on the left. He
       is presumably a Draper Company employee. See Item 862 and Item 863, in this folder, for images of another employee demonstrating this, and Box 15, Folder 2, Item 870 through Item 874 for images demonstrating this procedure using a skeleton. As the
       Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms, and did not manufacture cloth, it is unclear what relation this photograph has to Draper unless it was to demonstrate something with their looms. 20.25 x 25.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B873. February 15, 1911. Image depicts an unidentified man demonstrating how mill operatives would suck the thread through the eye of a shuttle by using a shuttle and a skeleton. The hand of the skeleton
       (the skeleton's arm is supported by the hand of the man) holds the shuttle to its mouth (the shuttle is supported by the man's other hand). Mill operatives would draw the thread through their mouths to help smooth it and make it easier to draw through
       the eye of the shuttle. However, sucking on cotton thread could eventually cause lung problems and did so in many mill operatives. The unidentified man wears a three-piece suit and wire-rimmed glasses. Whether he is a Draper Company executive or someone
       else is unknown. See also Item 871 and Item 872, in this folder, for other views of this man; Item 870 and Item 874, in this folder, for a younger man demonstrating the same thing; and Box 15, Folder 1, Item 862 and Item 863 to see a male mill operative
       demonstrate this operation on a mill floor. As the Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms, and did not manufacture cloth, it is unclear what relation this photograph has to Draper unless it was to demonstrate something with their
       looms. 25.25 x 20.25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed in 1974 from glass plate negative no.B1074. Image depicts Warren W. Dutcher (born 1812), who joined the Draper Company in 1856 and who operated the Temple Shop. Dutcher is shown from the waist up, wearing a dark, three-piece suit, dark bow
       tie, and white shirt. He is balding and has a white beard. Most likely a photograph of an oil painting. Notation on the reverse of the print reads: "W. W. Dutcher Apr 1, 1912" which is most likely the date this painting was photographed, as Dutcher
       appears to be in his 60s or 70s, which would place the image about 1880. 20.25 x 25 cm.</p>

      <p>Printed from glass plate negative no.B136. May 7, 1903. Image depicts a view of the west side of Hopedale Street in Hopedale, Massachusetts, showing two residential houses on the left, behind which are Draper Company buildings. Both houses are
       two-story wooden clapboard buildings with shutters at all the windows; the house nearer the center has an open front porch. Behind the two houses on the right is a three-story building with a tall smokestack, part of the Draper Company complex. The
       streets are unpaved, but Hopedale Street is lined with trees. Trolley tracks run along Hopedale Street. The unknown cross street has a sidewalk. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. See Box 12, Folder 4, Item 135 for a
