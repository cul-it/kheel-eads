            <p>Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities
                in the northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership
                size, political influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American
                organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's garment
                industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its members
                through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities,
                cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. In 1995, the
                ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form
                the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE).</p>

            <p>Henoch Mendelsund was born on March 26 (or 23), 1911. Active in the Jewish labor
                movement in his native Poland, he worked as a mechanic and attended Warsaw
                University. Mendelsund arrived in the U.S. in 1941 as one of 1,500 labor leaders and
                intellectuals rescued from the Nazis through the efforts of the ILGWU and other
                groups under special visas authorized by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He joined
                the ILGWU as a machine operator, and while working in the shop during the day, he
                attended the New School for Social Research at night, earning a master's degree in
                economics and sociology. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>In addition to his work in cloak shops, during the war, Mendelsund was a member of
                the National Coat and Suit Recovery Board staff. Mendelsund held many positions
                during his tenure with the ILGWU. In 1949, he became the secretary of Cloak
                Finishers' Local 9 and in 1953 became the assistant general manager of the New York
                Cloak Joint Board under Isadore Nagler. After Nagler's death in September 1959,
                Mendelsund became general manager, a post he held until 1973. He also served the
                union as a vice president, and was the director of the International Relations
                Department from 1968-1980. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>On April 2, 1973 Mendelsund's recommendation to provide initial funding for the
                establishment of the ILGWU Archives was approved by the New York Cloak Joint Board.
                Mendelsund assumed directorship of the newly created archives, and served as
                director until his retirement on March 31, 1986. It was through Mendelsund's
                untiring efforts that led to the creation of the archives, its professional and
                prosperous status, and its oral history program. He died on September 22, 1994.</p>

            <head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
            <p>The International Relations Department of the ILGWU was concerned primarily with
                outreach to foreign and international labor organizations, working conditions in
                foreign countries, and international organizing activities. The department worked
                closely with international relations units of national and international labor
                confederations, such as the Free Trade Union Committee (FTUC) and the International
                Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The collection consists of an interview
                with Henoch Mendelsund by E. Finn on August 30, 1978. Included is the typed
                transcript of the interview as well as the audio cassette. From his position as
                director of the International Relations Department, Mendelsund speaks of the union's
                early and continual interest in international affairs. He states that an actual
                international department was not formed until 1946 with Jay Lovestone serving as
                director until his departure to the AFL-CIO. While a department existed
                intermittently, Mendelsund does not place an emphasis on a formal organizational
                structure for the department as he feels the union was always involved in
                international affairs from its early inception, with or without an actual
                department. Even in the absence of a formal department, he illustrates that the
                union still had the Committee on International Affairs at the conventions,
                participating in missions, sending people to other countries, and collecting funds.
                Mendelsund discusses the lack of attention paid to unions and their involvement with
                international affairs, labor in respect to the State Department, and the role of
                labor attachs and representatives. Examined in the interview is the function and
                responsibility of unions and labor in international relations, as well as
                international affairs within the AFL-CIO. Mentioned are organizations such as the
                International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Trade Union
                Committee (TUC). Mendelsund concludes by discussing the place of labor in helping to
                organize and support trade unions in developing countries as well as the union's
                projects in Africa, including a trade school, medical equipment, and the generosity
                of members donating funds for union development.</p>
