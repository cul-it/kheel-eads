            <head id="a5" altrender="organizational history">ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY </head>
            <p>The Board of Arbitration was established following an agreement between the parties
                September 28, 1962, made pursuant to a request of the President of the United States
                that the strike in progress on the lines of the carrier be terminated and the
                remaining issues be submitted to arbitration. </p>
            <p>Members of the Board included B. W. Heineman, representing the carrier; G. E.
                Leighty, representing the organization; upon nomination by President Kennedy,
                Sylvester Garrett was designated by the National Mediation Board as the third and
                neutral member of the Board. </p>
            <p>Hearings commenced October 2, 1962, in Washington, D.C., and were concluded October
                4. The award was rendered October 8, 1962. </p>
            <p>This proceeding developed out of the handling of a notice served by the organization
                on the carrier for a rule that: "no position in existence on December 3, 1957, will
                be abolished or discontinued except by agreement between the carrier and the
                organization." </p>
            <p>The customary procedures of direct negotiation, mediation and emergency board
                recommendations were exhausted without agreement. A work stoppage occurred. In
                settlement of the dispute the parties agreed upon a program of employee protection
                as recommended by Emergency Board No. 147 except for four areas of disagreement
                which were submitted to this Arbitration Board for resolution at the request of the
                President. In submitting the questions at issue for settlement, the parties stated: </p>
            <p>"It is agreed that each question shall be resolved and decided by the panel on the
                basis of and in terms of its determination of the proper application to the question
                of the Report and Recommendations of Emergency Board No. 147, dated June 14, 1962." </p>
            <p>The four specific questions and the decisions of the Board follow. The representative
                of the organization indicated a dissent in the decision in response to questions
                two, three, and four. </p>
            <p>1. What shall be established as a substantial period of advance notice to be given by
                the Carrier to the Union of a decision to permanently discontinue any position? </p>
            <p>2. What procedures should be followed when the Carrier and the Union do not agree on
                whether a position should be abolished? </p>
            <p>3. The U. S. Emergency Board No. 147 recommended a forty-hour workweek guarantee for
                extra board employees. Should the Union or the Carrier decide on the size of the
                extra board? </p>
            <p>4. Should the Union be allowed to pursue claims against the Carrier which resulted
                from jobs abolished before the current agreement was made?</p>
