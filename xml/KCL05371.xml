            <p>Of current interest to many scholars and politicians is the issue of unionization in
                government and the industries directly effecting the public health and safety, ie.,
                the public utilities. Various formulas and solutions have been presented by both
                public and private sources, but most of these do not contain a generally applicable
                answer to the question of how to provide employees with the right to organize and
                bargain collectively and yet maintain the vital public services of these
                institutions. </p>
            <p>After a wave of strikes in 1946, the State of New Jersey attempted to solve this
                problem through passage of a statute providing for seizure of struck public
                utilities and operation of these utilities by the government for the duration of the
                strike. This statute was amended in 1947 by a provision for compulsory arbitration
                of the issues of a work stoppage or the issues preventing new contract
                determination. A punitive penalty of ten thousand dollars per day was to be levied
                against any union which struck a public utility with an additional $250-500 penalty
                to be ordered against any person or persons who aided or abetted such a stoppage. An
                additional provision stated that each day of work stoppage was to be considered a
                new offense. </p>
            <p>On April 7, 1947. the Traffic Telephone Workers Federation went on strike against the
                Bell Telephone Company in New Jersey. On April 10, the governor filed suit against
                the . Union for $10,000 under the terms of the public utilities statute. On the
                following day, officers of the Telephone Federation and several other employees of
                the telephone company were arrested and subsequently released on $500 bond. </p>
            <p>A case was brought before the District Court by the American Civil Liberties Union to
                enjoin the application of the statute. An injunction was thereby ordered against the
                enforcement of the statute pending the determination of constitutionality by a
                higher court. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court of the State of New
                Jersey. </p>
            <p>In a memorandum opinion, Vice-Chancellor Bigelow of the Supreme Court upheld the
                constitutionality of the statute as a valid exercise of state police power and
                further stated that the seizure was of the "pro forma" or protective custody typo
                and, as such, did not deprive the parties "of their property without due process.
                The Supreme Court of New Jersey later upheld this opinion.</p>
