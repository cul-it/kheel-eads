			<p>The Ladies' Society of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen (BLF and
				E) was organized in April 1884 in Tucson, Arizona by the wife of a railroad fireman,
				Georgia M. Sargent. The first meeting of the Ladies' Society was held at the "little
				adobe home" of Frank and Georgia Sargent. The constitution and by-laws were
				published in the May 1884 issue of the Firemen's Magazine. This lodge had to
				disband, because the terminal of the railroad changed. A second lodge, using the
				already established constitution and by-laws, was organized in August 1884, in
				Stratford, Ontario. For the following six years, the Ladies' Society ran itself and
				established twelve lodges for its members. The Ladies' Society was formally
				recognized as an auxiliary of the Brotherhood at its second biennial convention in
				San Francisco in 1890. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The Ladies' Society was organized "for the purpose of rendering assistance,
				encouraging the Brotherhood ... in its good work, extending the hand of Charity,
				helping each other in time of need, and elevating our social and intellectual
				standing. It is also the aim of the Society to cultivate a spirit of harmony, to
				promote sociability, and to draw into friendly and affectionate relationship the
				lady members of the families of the Brotherhood." In addition to the social
				features, the Ladies' Society offered insurance to its members "considered the best
				of its kind [and] is a guarantee to the members' participating therein that their
				loved ones shall receive, without unnecessary delay, the protection it affords"
				("History of the Ladies' Society," Box 2, Folder 1).</p>

			<p>Records included in the collection document the organizing, founding, and daily
				business of the Ladies' Society of the BLF and E, as well as some biographical
				information and photographs of grand presidents and co-founders. Various editions of
				the constitutions and general laws of the Ladies' Society from 1904 to 1968 are
				found in this collection as well as the Journal of Proceedings of the First Biennial
				Convention of the Ladies' Society held in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1892. A Report of
				Receipts and Disbursements for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1903, sent from the
				office of the Board of Grand Trustees to all member lodges documents the Ladies'
				Society's finances, number of lodges, and payments made to members of the
				Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Engineers. Finally, two bound ledgers record
				the dates, locations, and circumstances of the organizing and disbanding of various
				lodges. These ledgers also contain additional information about the Ladies' Society
				and its membership. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Additional records found in this collection document the institutional history of the
				Ladies' Society. A typed manuscript, written in 1934 by Agnes G. Strong (Grand
				President, 1925-1947), gives a historical review of the Ladies' Society, prepared
				for the Society's Golden Jubilee; other histories of the Ladies' Society, by unknown
				authors, are also included. There are also programs from the memorial service for
				the founder of the Ladies' Society, Georgia M. Sargent, and from the Golden
				Anniversary of Lodge 56 in Tucson, Arizona, where the Society was founded.
				Photographs of all former Grand Lodge presidents and two founding members, which
				include Joshua A. Leach (founder of the BLF and E) and his wife Sarah (Grand
				President, 1895-1898), as well as Georgia M. Sargent (Grand President, 1899-1912)
				and her husband Frank (Counselor-Brother, 1898), are found in this collection, in
				additional to a photograph of an ambulance donated by the Ladies' Society.</p>
