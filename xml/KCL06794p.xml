						<p>Gelatin silver print snapshot, March 21, 1936. Image depicts the Balmoral Spa (left background) and Shawsheen Square in Shawsheen Village (part of Andover, Mass.) during the flood of 1936. Water is now about three-quarters of the way
							up the first-floor windows. See item 28 in this folder for a view of the Spa taken a day earlier. Written on reverse of photo: "Shawsheen Square - Water was later as high as the bottom of the light on Silent Policeman." The Silent
							Policeman is probably the marker in the center right labeled "Slow Keep Right" which would indicate that the water rose at least one foot higher than seen here. 17.5 x 9.25 cm.</p>
