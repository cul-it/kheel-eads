   <p>This collection is divided into three series: </p>
   <p>I: Images of Mills, Alphabetical by Location. Consists entirely of stereoscopic images arranged alphabetically by state, then by ciy/town. Most of the images are of mills, both interior and exterior views. Also includes views from around the mill towns. </p>
   <p>II: General Images Organized by Textile Related Subject. Consists of a mix of about 40% stereoscopic images and 60% postcards. These images are arranged by subject based on ATHM numerically coded "TT" local subject headings. The subject headings have
    been kept, but the "TT" codings have been dropped. Most of the images depict the production of cotton and wool, though there is a section on flax and other fibers. Subjects include both fiber production, growing wool and cotton, and processing into cloth. </p>
   <p>III: Pacific Mills Images Organized by Textile Related Subject. Consists entirely of stereoscopic images arranged by subject, the same as Series II. The images depict the production of cotton and wool textiles, with subjects focusing on the production of
    cloth. </p>
   <p>A stereoscopic viewer is included in the collection in order to view the stereoscopic images in 3D.</p>
  </scopecontent>
  <processinfo encodinganalog="MARC 583">
   
   <p>This collection has been kept in the order it was in when received from the American Textile History Museum. The subject groupings in Series II and Series III are based on the local subject headings defined by ATHM. These subject headings were coded
    numerically, TT1 through TT 63. The Kheel Center has not kept the "TT" designations and has only retained the subject headings themselves. </p>
   <p>The descriptive hierarchy follows the standard box/folder/item scheme. However, in the case of this collection the "folder" level represents a section of the box, rather than an actual physical folder.</p>

        the river. Building has sign which reads "Henry Parker, Bobbins &amp; Spools". [Mill buildings were Parker's Mills and also Gould's Mills at a later date.] There is a small pile of logs next to the mill buildings. There are houses down river and
        uphill from the mill. 17.7 x 10 cm.</p>

       <p>Photo of Crystal Lee Jordan Sutton shown on front of card with several workers in background. On front of card is this quote: "I knew this union was the only way we could have our own voice, make ourselves a better way of life." Crystal Lee. Printed
        on reverse: Crystal Lee Jordan Sutton (b. 1940). Born into a North Carolina weaving family, she became a dynamic organizer of textile workers in the landmark J.P. Stevens unionizing drive of 1973-74, in her native Roanoke Rapids, a "company" town.
        Textiles &amp; clothing is the only basic U.S. industry not fully organized, despite a southern workforce of 700,000. "Brown lung," deafening noise, and low pay are among the argued issues. The Textile Workers Union of America * [*now the
        Amalgamated Clothing Textile Workers Union] targeted Crystal's town. One night during her shift she stood up alone to management and went to jail; but TWUA won the subsequent election &amp; a contract. The company still refuses to comply legally
        and a widely publized product boycott continues. Martinsville, Ind.: Helaine Victoria Press, ca. 1979. 14 x 9 cm.</p>

       <p>Black-and-white image shows a room where two men and a woman work at desks with large designs. More designs are hung in the room. Text on reverse: "Designing Room for Cloth to be Woven on Jacquard Looms - Silk Industry, So. Manchester, Conn., U.S.A.
        This view shows a Jacquard designing room where the designs for cloth woven on a Jacquard loom are made. Incidentally, it should be noted that the invention of the Jacquard loom, both because of its ingenuity and because of its far-reaching effects, is
        probably the most important invention in the textile industry. The machine is named after Joseph Marie Jacquard who first made use of the principle. Jacquard was born in Lyons, France, on the seventh of July, 1752; he died in 1834. By the use of the
        Jacquard looms very elaborate patterns for figured or brocaded goods with a large variety of weaves may be produced. In this picture we get a glance into a corner of the Jacquard designing room of the Cheney Bros. plant in South Manchester, Conn. A few
        of the numerous varied designs are to be seen spread out near the group of expert designers seen at work in this room. The design is first made of the proper size and then transferred to paper ruled in squares. Each square represents the intersection
        of a warp and a filling thread. From the way in which the design falls on these squares the card cutter can tell how to punch the cards which control the motion of the warp thread." Meadville, Pa.: Keystone View Company. 17.75 x 8.75 cm. Copy A.</p>

        generally done by burning. After that the land is ploughed and harrowed. Once the ground has been seeded and plants begin to grow, they must be thinned out, leaving the strongest only. Then a plow is run between the ridges, throwing up the earth
        against the plants. This is banking up or bedding up and is what is seen here. Meadville, Pa.: Keystone View Company, ca. 1905. 17.75 x 8.75 cm.</p>

        fiber, and the fiber is tied and baled. An average hemp field yields about one thousand pounds per acre. Meadville, Pa.: Keystone View Company, ca. 1900-1920. 17.75 x 8.75 cm.</p>

        supporting frame has four upright posts with braces. There are two long booms. These booms or poles have been called "buzzard wings." Animal hitches were attached to the booms. Mules and oxen were used to rotate the screw. The overall height of the
        press is 22 ft. The octagonal roof was built over the press sometime after 1938 and was removed by 1976. Printed by Clayton's of Tarboro, N.C. ca. 1960. 13 x 8 cm.</p>

        find the silk ends and enabling "hanks" of silk to be taken off for use if desired by the weavers. This process is lacing. The plant is unidentified; Paterson in the mid-teens had literally several hundred silk mills. New York: Underwood &amp;        Underwood. 17.75 x 8.5 cm.</p>

        is pointing to her as she undresses; she is not "finally alone" as the title suggests. A grandfather clock and a flax spinning wheel are also in the scene on the left. Artaud et Nozais, Imp-Eoit, Nantes. [no earlier than 1904] 9 x 14 cm.</p>

       <p>Black-and-white image depicts a ladies' parlor wheel, identified as a ladies' parlor wheel from St. Albans, England, although it is unclear from where this information comes. A parlor wheel took up less space because the spinning apparatus was
        mounted above the drive wheel, which in turn was mounted above the bench and treadle. The little fence, the drawer below it, the treadle at right angles to the spindle, the foot rest in front of the treadle, and the footman on the spinster's side of
        the spinning wheel are all unusual features. Textile Department, Bankfield Museum, Halifax [Yorkshire,England]. [before 1962] 9 x 14 cm.</p>

        during 1692--following the rebellion of 1680--coming with the De Vargas expedition of re-conquest, were a group of Mexicans from Chimayo, Mexico. They settled a village naming it Chimayo and builded [sic] a Sanctuario. They brought their art of weaving
        and individual designs with them, and after more than 200 years, tho their Spaish descendants have removed to Santa Fe and other towns, they follow both design and method of weaving their hand-made woolen blankets with scrupulous accuracy, so that
        today they are made into many useful and ornamental articles, ladies' coats, purses, throws, etc., being among them." Genuine Curteich-chicago "C.T. Art-Colortone" Post Card. Distributed by Southwest Post Card Co., Box 685, Albuquerque, N.M. ca.

        a Navajo rug in the Indians' home or Hogan, which is done in the winter time. In summer, the weaving is done outdoors under the shade of a tree. After the wool has been sheared from the sheep, sorted and washed, it is carded, to make the fibers lie in
        one direction, which is here being done by the small girl in the center. It is then worked into a cord and wound upon a distaff, which is being done by the woman at the left. This operation is repeated many times until the cord has been twisted to the
        desired fineness and hardness. That which is to be red is then dyed. The last step is the weaving. The manner of weaving and the loom with an unfinished blanket, or rug, are shown at the right. These fabrics, of all wool, and entirely hand made are
        becoming greatly appreciated for their wearing qualities no less than their striking beauty." C.T. American Art Colored. Postmarked Jul. 26, 1944 in Biggs Field, Texas. 14 x 9 cm.</p>

        cloth. The yarn running lengthwise is called warp; the crosswise threads are called filling (in England, called weft). Explanations of the five operations in weaving--shedding, picking, beating up, letting off, and taking up--are on the reverse of the

        Cotton Cloth, Lawrence, Mass. [explanation of weaving and singing cloth] . This cloth is now ready for market as white cloth. But much of the demand is for colored or patterned goods. The patterns are printed on the white cloth by copper rolls, much
        after the fashion of paper printing on roller presses. To get the design on the rolls is the next step. This is the making and the transferring of the design. Skilled artists draft suitable designs. These are photographed, engraved on zinc, and
        transferred to the copper rollers by a chemical process. Each color demands a separate plate. The girl in the view is busy painting on the engraved zinc plate, those parts of the pattern which belong to one color. Making ready the copper rolls for
        printing is one of the most interesting processes of cloth manufacture." ca. 1914. 17.75 x 8.75 cm.</p>

       <p>Black and white image shows a large crowd of people at an outdoor cloth market. The "fair," which contains a variety of goods and hosts "hundreds of thousands of visitors and traders" from all over Russia, is actually a market-place that has operated
        during the summer "[f]or at least six centuries." The building in the background may be a permanent structure that only sees use during the market season; the location is practically deserted outside of the summer. Events such as World War I and the
        Russian Revolution caused a dwindling in the market's significance. Meadville, Pa.: Keystone View Company, ca. 1920. 17.75 x 9 cm.</p>

        the large bale of cotton at the foot of the feeder. Shreds of cotton remain in the "teeth" of the bale breaker. 18 x 9 cm.</p>
