			<p>After the conclusion of a twenty-six day strike by the workers on the LIRR, 
				the BRT and its officers filed suit against the LIRR, the AAR, and other 
				ssociated corporate entities, alleging that sometime prior to 1959, the 
				vice-president in charge of the law department of the AAR met with designated 
				representatives of the other railroad defendants, including the LIRR, to create 
				a pool of their assets and earnings for the purpose of assisting any participating 
				member which might be affected by a work stoppage or strike. The plaintiffs argued 
				that this artificially strengthened the economic bargaining position of individual 
				railroad companies in collective bargaining with unions.  </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The BRT and its officers contended that the costs the union incurred during the strike, 
				which was prompted by the failure of collective bargaining and mediation proceedings 
				between the LIRR and the BRT in 1959-1960 to establish a five day work week without 
				a reduction in pay for the LIRR's employees, were a result of the LIRR entering 
				into the "strike insurance" pool.  This suit was filed to determine the legality 
				of the LIRR, AAR, and other associated railroads entering into this pool with 
				the understanding that if the "strike insurance" was itself illegal, then the defendants 
				would be liable for the damages incurred by the plaintiffs while their members were in 
				strike. The plaintiffs further charged that the defendants used some funds from the 
				pool to run a campaign through the AAR's public relations department designed to 
				influence public opinion against organized labor. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The only question under consideration by the court was whether the LIRR's purchase of 
				"strike insurance" through the AAR was illegal. In 1962, the court found that it was not. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Not included in this collection is the decision of the court, which found in favor of
				the defendants and dismissed the suit without cost [211 F. Supp. 478 (S.D.N.Y.
				1962)]. The decision of the court may be found <extref href="http://www.ecases.us/case/nysd/c1888002/kennedy-v-long-island-railroad-company">here</extref>.</p>

			<head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
			<p>Inclusive date range: 1961-1962 </p>
			<p>Bulk date: 1961 </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>This collection consists of two copies of a brief filed on behalf of the BRT, et al., 
				plaintiffs, by W. P. Kennedy against the LIRR the AAR and associated corporate 
				entities, as well as the jointly prepared record of proceedings, which include 
				the exhibits to joint stipulation of facts, contained in three bound volumes. The 
				brief and the bound volumes of the proceeding contain tables of contents and lists 
				of exhibits presented during the proceedings. The plaintiffs were seeking monetary 
				recompense for damages suffered during a 26 day strike in the summer of 1960 as well 
				as questioning the legality of the LIRR entering, under the auspices of the AAR, 
				into a "strike insurance" monetary pool with other rail carriers in order to 
				strengthen their position in collective bargaining with their employees' unions. 
				Plaintiffs charged that this action was in violation of the Railway Labor Act, 
				the Interstate Commerce Act, and the Sherman Act. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Included in the plaintiffs' exhibits are reproductions of advertisements the AAR 
				ran in daily newspapers, condemning the practice of "featherbedding" (i.e. retaining 
				jobs that are identified as obsolete, generally as the result of a union contract). 
				These ads compare the cost of featherbedding to the railroads with major American 
				disasters, such as the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and the Chicago fire of 1871, 
				in an attempt, the plaintiffs argue, to turn public opinion against the unions. Also 
				included in the exhibits are excerpts from the BRT's weekly newsletter and the 
				newspaper, Labor.</p>
