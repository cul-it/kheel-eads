            <p>First established in 1918 as the Woman in Industry Service, the Women's Bureau was
                made a permanent part of the Department of Labor by act of Congress in 1920. The
                Bureau was mandated "to formulate standards and policies which promote the welfare
                of wage-earning women, improve their working conditions, increase their efficiency,
                and advance their opportunities for profitable employment ...[with] authority to
                investigate and report to the said [Labor] Department on all matters pertaining to
                the welfare of women in industry."</p>

            <head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
            <p>Part 1 of the Bureau's records consist of four series summarizing its work from the
                time of its predecessor, the Woman in Industry Service, to the mid 1960's and
                providing regular summaries of the Bureau's activities and policy positions. These
                are: Monthly reports (1918-1948); Annual summaries (1922-1932); Conferences of the
                Women's Bureau (1918-1965); and speeches and articles prepared by Women's Bureau
                officers (1918-1958). </p>
            <p>Monthly reports of the director of the Women's Bureau (1918-1948) begin with the
                Woman in Industry Service. Reports were submitted to the Secretary of Labor and
                summarize all of the Bureau's activities of the preceeding month. Major projects
                within each division are monitored, including progress on survey work for the
                studies eventually published in the BULLETIN. Reports also provide overviews of the
                Bureau's lobbying and legislative consulting activities, its consultations with
                private groups and businesses and labor representatives, as well as its public
                service and educational activities. </p>
            <p>Annual summaries (1922-1932) provide summary material similar to that found in the
                monthly reports but emphasize the annual, rather than the monthly, perspective. </p>
            <p>Conferences of the Women's Bureau (1918-1965) constitute the largest component of
                Part 1. The conferences document the key issues concerning the Bureau from one
                decade to the next, as well as the roles played by individuals, government agencies
                and private organizations. Included are conference transcripts, agenda, lists of
                participants, summary minutes and reports, speeches, and background correspondence
                relative to organizing the conferences. </p>
            <p>Speeches (1918-1958) and articles (1918-1947) of Women's Bureau officers were
                prepared for a wide variety of audiences and media and demonstrate the Bureau's
                policy positions on a wide range of topics as well as the extent of its educational
                efforts.</p>
