   <p>John Mitchell was born in Braidwood, Illinois on February 4, 1870, the son of Robert Mitchell,
    a Scotch-Irish immigrant, and Martha Halley. His mother died soon after he was born, and his
    father died when he was six. Reared by his father's third wife, Mitchell had little opportunity
    for schooling and spent much of his time helping his stepmother with "taking in" the
    neighborhood washing. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>At the age of ten, Mitchell left home and went to work on a neighboring farm carrying water to
    the hired help. When he was twelve, he returned to Braidwood where he began to work in the mines
    as a trapper boy; although Illinois law required a miner to be thirteen, the law was not
    enforced at the time. As a trapper boy, Mitchell opened and closed the wooden doors that
    separated sections within the mines, an operation which controlled ventilation. From trapper
    boy, he was slowly promoted to become a mule driver, a miner's helper, and finally a
    full-fledged miner. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>When he was sixteen, Mitchell went west and worked in the mines of Colorado, but in 1888 he
    returned to Illinois and found employment in Spring Valley. After a ten-month miners' strike in
    1891, he left for New Mexico, but later returned to Spring Valley. In 1892, he married Catherine
    O'Rourke and soon settled down to the miner's daily routine. The panic of 1893 and a strike by
    the miners of Illinois in 1894 added to the usual struggles of a young couple, and when a new
    English mine superintendent fired all the Irish workers at Mitchell's mine following the strike,
    Mitchell found himself without a job. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Mitchell found work in another camp where William D. Ryan, an old friend from Braidwood, had
    previously worked. Ryan, now a railroad employee and secretary of the sub-district of northern
    Illinois for the United Mine Workers, selected Mitchell as secretary-treasurer of the
    sub-district, which in effect made Mitchell the financial officer for the UMW in the state of
    Illinois. At the same time, Mitchell was sent to the state capital at Springfield as a lobbyist
    for the miners' cause. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>While lobbying on behalf of the Illinois UMW interests, Mitchell successfully used his
    influence to secure reform in the state's labor laws. Through his efforts, a weighing law, a
    child labor law, and an act establishing a two year apprenticeship for miners were passed.
    Legislation also was enacted exempting the miners and operators from anti-trust laws, thereby
    permitting the miners and operators to sit in joint convention and establish appropriate price
    scales. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>In 1897, Mitchell became a member of the Illinois UMW State Executive Board, and Ryan became
    state secretary- treasurer. On July 4 of that year the national UMW declard its first successful
    strike, and following its conclusion in September, Mitchell chaired a joint meeting of operators
    and miners in northern Illinois. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>In 1898, at the age of twenty-seven, Mitchell was sent as an Illinois delegate to the National
    UMW convention. The vice- presidential aspirants of that year considered this office a stepping
    stone to the presidency because they fully expected president Michael Ratchford to resign and
    accept a position ith the United States Industrial Commission. In this contest, Ohio,
    Pennsylvania and Illinois UMW leaders each sought the vice presidential spot for a member from
    their respective states. With the help of his friend Ryan, who by now was a member of the UMW
    National Executive Committee, Mitchell was elected to this office. Ratchford accepted the post
    with the United States Industrial Commission in September, 1898, and precipitated a heated
    controversy over whether Mitchell should be allowed to succeed to the presidency. In an effort
    to avoid a divisive struggle that an extraordinary convention in the fall of 1898 might entail,
    Mitchell was permitted to succeed Ratchford as acting president of the UMW. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The summer and fall of 1898 were troubled times for a union which urgently needed unity. West
    Virginia operators had not participated in the joint negotiations of 1898, and were expanding
    their markets into those states where operators had signed agreements with the UMW. Also,
    several operators in Illinois did not accept the agreement and imported black strikebreakers,
    which provoked violence. Riots in such areas as Pana, Illinois, on September 28, 1898, and the
    Virden massacre of October 12 of that year, indicated a general lack of unification of the UMW
    in Illinois. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>As National UMW vice-president, John Mitchell sought to organize workers in West Virginia and
    to persuade the miners in Illinois to accept the agreement of the multi-state joint conference.
    As acting president, he sent organizers into Kansas, Iowa, Arkansas, Oklahoma and other fields. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>In January, 1899, Mitchell was elected president of the national UMW in his own right and in
    the fall of the year he went to eastern Pennsylvania in an attempt to organize its anthracite
    fields. Working conditions in the Susquehanna and Schulykill valleys were desperate,
    characterized by low wages, long hours, company owned houses and stores, child labor, and a
    higher incidence of industrial accidents and deaths than in the bituminous fields. Racial,
    ethnic, and language differences separated the miners in the anthracite area. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The operators were controlled basically by seven coal-carrying railraods which in turn were
    controlled by JP Morgan and Cornelius Vanderbilt. After some success in the soft coal fields,
    Mitchell was tested in the anthracite region where unorganized laborers numbered more than the
    enitre membership of the UMW. Mitchell enlisted the aid of clergymen and worked to change the
    thinking of many who had opposed unions initially. After five months of organizing, he succeeded
    in attracting to the ranks of the UMW only ten thousand of the one hundred fifty thousand
    eligible miners. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Mitchell left the anthracite fields of Pennsylvania briefly to report his progress to the UMW
    national office and to participate in the 1899 bituminous joint conference which extracted a
    twenty percent wage increase. He returned to the anthracite fields in August, 1900, and called a
    convention in Scranton, Pennsylvania, of the three anthracite districts which formulated demands
    for a wage increase. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The anthracite miners had not received an advance in wages since 1880, and the UMW National
    Executive Board authorized Mitchell to call a strike in the entire anthracite field if the
    convention's demands were not met. The operators ignored his request for arbitration, and the
    UMW called for a strike to commence on September 17, 1900. Despite the low membership count, one
    hundred twelve thousand workers responded and conducted the strike with restraint. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Writing John Mitchell on September 5, 1900, Daniel J. Keefe, president of the International
    Longshoreman's Association, expresesd the hope that the UMW would see a satisfactory conclusion
    to the coming struggle. Mitchell replied the next day that the coal operators did not respond to
    his offer of arbitration and that he feared a strike would be declared. Telegrams were sent on
    the twelfth to Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Hudson, Lackawanna, Central of New Jersey, Reading,
    and Erie Railroads, notifying them of an imminent strike and again requesting arbitration. On
    the same day, a circular was sent out calling for a strike, the coal miners to cease work on the
    seventeenth if no settlement was reached. Samuel Gompers, on the thirteenth, proferred what
    support he could. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>On the same day, the UMW issued a circular stating the rationale for the strike. The cost of
    living had increased by ten percent. Under these circumstances, lack of a wage increase was
    tantamount to a wage reduction. Despite Pennsylvania statutes specifying 2400 pounds as a legal
    ton of anthracite coal, the miners were compelled to load a company ton ranging from 2700 to
    4000 pounds, and, in addition, their wages were docked up to 12 percent for any impurities
    therein. The car had to be topped out at 18 inches above the edge. Miners were forced to
    purchase their own powder at exorbitant rates, and, as a condition of employment, were required
    to ransact business in "pluck me" stores. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>On the sixteenth, R.N. Mason, an Ohio mine inspector, expressed the view that the nation's
    attention was riveted upon the anthracite strike, and considered the endeavor the "greatest
    labor struggle in the history of nations." In a letter of the seventeenth to the Reverend John
    F. Power, Mitchell explained that the UMW struck only after all reasonable measures to bring
    about an honorable settlement were exhausted, and noted the personal attacks by an
    operator-controlled regional press. John Fahy, president of UMW District 9 (Shamokin,
    Pennsylvania), informed Mitchell that there was an overwhelming response to the strike call. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Beginning on the nineteenth, status reports on the strike were issued, which detailed the
    percentage of striking and working miners in the anthracite fields. They also noted at any given
    time whether the operators struck against were badly crippled, slightly crippled, or continuing
    to function. Companies noted are Lehigh Valley, Reading, Markle, Van Vickle, Pardee, Cross
    Creks, Morgans, and others. By this date, seventy-four percent of the anthracite miners were on
    strike. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>On October 1, 1900, the Reading Company posted a ten percent increase. The collection includes
    copies of the October 1, 3, and 17 notices of the Reading Company, and an October 2 notice of
    the Lackawanna. On the 12th, a convention convened at Scranton, PA, for the purpose of deciding
    whether to accept the operators' offer. On the 13th, the convention agreed to the operators'
    offer of a ten percent advance, provided that the agreement would not expire until April 1,
    1901, nd that the sliding scale would be abolished. On the 17th, the Reading Company and others
    gave their consent. Letters from Mitchell expressed his view that the strike was a weapon of the
    last resort. He hoped that ultimately the operators in the anthracite fields would emulate the
    practice of their bituminous confreres by engaging in joint interstate agreements with the UMW,
    thereby decreasing the possibility of strikes. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The election of 1900 was an important factor in the early settlement of the 1900 anthracite
    strike. Marcus Alonzo Hanna, a spokesman for big business and a staunch supporter of the
    Republican party, sougt to avoid the embarrassment of a labor-management conflict for President
    William McKinley. When the operators refused to meet with Mitchell, Hanna arranged a meeting
    with JP Morgan, a financier of the operators. On October 3, 1900, labor delegates in convention
    proposed a ten percent increase in wages, abolition of the sliding wage scale (i.e., a scale
    dependent upon market fluctuations), and the recognition of workers' grievance committees. The
    operators refused to acknowledge the convention, but in October 10, 1900, posted notices which
    implied acceptance of the terms. The workers declared victory, and on October 29, 1900, the
    strike ended officially. This date was later declared Mitchell Day by the miners because of the
    UMW president's role in the strike. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Despite his victory in the anthracite fields of Pennsylvania, John Mitchell was faced with
    opposition in the ranks. At the January, 1901, UMW national convention, he was confronted by
    Thomas Lewis, Patrick Dolan, and socialists and radicals within the union. Lewis, the national
    UMW vice-president, led whatever serious opposition there was to Mitchell, though to no avail. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>At the same time, Mitchell found himself confronting the American Federation of Labor in the
    matter of a jurisdictional dispute. Samuel Gompers, president of the AFL, rebuked the UMW and
    Mitchell for gathering into its ranks unskilled workers and skilled craftsmen from separate
    trades such as the engineers, pumpmen, firemen, carpenters, and blacksmiths who worked in and
    around the mines. Mitchell defended the practice as essential in that three percent of the
    workers who were skilled could throw the ninety-seven percent of the remaining miners out of
    work by striking. Gompers later conceded Mitchell's point, which resulted in the Scranton
    Declaration permitting the UMW exclusively to continue the practice. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The Strike of 1900 was but a skirmish compared to the anthracite coal strike of 1902. In that
    year, the miners perceived their conditions as so desperate that they were willing to sacrifice
    heavily to have their grievances properly rectified. The success of the miners in a struggle for
    better wages and working conditions depended on the ability of the UMW to organize the workers
    and to convince the operators to accept demands they adamantly opposed. This movement was
    personally directed by John Mitchell as president of the UMW and architect of the strategy for
    the miners. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The January convention of the UMW in Indianapolis authorized Mitchell to call, with the advice
    of the National Executive Board, a sectional or national suspension of work in the bituminous
    regions. This action was designed to assist him if he considered a nationwide strike necessary
    in order to organize the anthracite regions, where previously the operators had done nothing to
    recognize the legitimacy of the union. On February 13, 1902, Mitchell sent invitations to all
    the operators of mines in the anthracite regions to meet the following month to discuss wages
    and prices in a joint conference. Within a week, he received negative replies from every
    operator. Also, in February, he met with JP Morgan to secure his intervention as financier for
    the operators. This tactic had succeeded and resulted in a wage increase two years before, but
    this time Morgan told Mitchell that he must attempt to deal with the operators on his own. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>On March 18, representatives of three union districts of the anthracite region met in
    Shamokin, Pennsylvania, to discuss demands to present when the current wage scale expired on
    April 1, 1902. The Shamokin Convention demaned an eight hour day, a twenty percent increase in
    wages, a rate of sixty cents per ton fixed at 2,240 pounds, and recognition by the operators of
    the union in a contractual agreement. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The Industrial Department of the National Civic Federation, on request of the miners, arranged
    a meeting between railroad presidents, who exercised control over the mine operators, and a
    miners' committee. This meeting was fruitless, but a strike was postponed for thirty days. On
    May 1, the National Civic Federation transmitted John Mitchell's offer of a five per cent
    increase or arbitration. The operators refused the increase or any settlement by arbitration. On
    May 13, an executive committee of miners ordered a temporary work stoppage and on May 15, at a
    convention of the three districts' representatives in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, the miners voted,
    despite Mitchell's opposition, to extend the strike. Mitchell urged the miners to act together
    and avoid violence. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Mitchell issued a call on June 18 for a special national convention to meet in Indianapolis on
    July 18. Sentiment among the bituminous mine leaders was strongly in favor of a national strike
    in sympathy with those striking in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Mitchell opposed a
    sympathetic strike, asserting that they usually failed and that the workers who had union
    contracts should honor them as sacred. Also, he advised the workers that the striking miners
    would need financial assistance desperately during the strike, which could be provided only by
    assessing the other miners. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Mitchell then detailed to the special convention his plan for the best way to aid those in the
    three anthracite districts: the national treasury should contribute $50,000, all local
    treasuries should give what they could, and a one dollar assessment per member should be made.
    Further, all union officials earning above a certain amount should be assessed twenty-five
    percent of their salaries. Finally, an appeal to other unions and the general public for
    financial support was outlined. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>By August and September, the effects of the strike were apparent in the major eastern cities;
    for example, the price of a ton of coal in New York City jumped from five to twenty dollars.
    With winter approaching and neither side acknowledging defeat, politicians and public opinion
    urged a settlement, the public having become more sympathetic to the strikers as their working
    conditions and the restraint of their strike conduct were publicized. In late September, a
    letter from George Baer, president of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, implying a divine
    right of capitalists to dictate business terms, received widespread publicity that embarrassed
    the operators. On September 26 the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad demanded that its workers
    return to their posts or be fired. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>On September 28, Pennsylvania Governor Stone pledged state troops to protect any miner who
    desired to return to work. The strike continued. On September 29, as Mitchell and the district
    leaders were discussing plans to propose public ownership of the mines, President Theodore
    Roosevelt announced his intention to take a personal hand in the crisis. The President sent
    telegrams to Mitchell and the operators requesting a meeting at the White House on October 3. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>John Mitchell and the three district presidents met with Roosevelt, five mine operators
    including Baer, and three cabinet officials. President Roosevelt acknowledged no legal right or
    duty to intervene, but appealed to the men's patriotism to settle the strike. Mitchell
    acknowledged the gravity of the situation, but recounted that the offers to meet with the
    operators were rebuffed. He proposed that the union would accept as binding the decision of a
    presidential commission. This evidently suited the President. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>After an adjournment to allow time for the operators to draw up a written response, George
    Baer read the statement. He outlined the President's duties "to restore majesty of the law." The
    operators refused conciliation and insisted that the President restore law and order. Roosevelt
    was infuriated by the operators. Later efforts by the President were rebuffed until the pressure
    of public opinion indicated that the next session of Congress might declare public ownership of
    the mines. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The operators knew that Roosevelt would not veto such legislation, but would eagerly welcome
    it. On October 13, J.P. Morgan went to the White House to announce that the operators would
    accept arbitration. The President appointed a commission of seven members agreeable to the
    operators and Mitchell. On October 20 and 21, the anthracite miners, after a debate, decided to
    return to work on October 23. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The report of the Anthracite Coal Strike Commission was issued on March 21, 1903. After five
    months of testimony from 588 witnesses, including four days of intensive cross examination of
    John Mitchell by Wayne MacVeagh, counsel for the Pennsylvania Coal Company, the Commission
    formulated its decision. The miners were awarded a ten percent increase in wages, an eight-hour
    day for engineers and firemen and nine hours for other miners. The commission refused to compel
    union recognition, and, while denying the demand for a standard weight, it established a sliding
    scale with a procedure for determining the scale on the basis of market conditions. A permanent
    conciliation board, composed of one miner and one operator for each of the three anthracite
    districts, was established to settle grievances. Despite some glaring defects, the Commission's
    decision was acceptable to the UMW. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>From March, 1903, to March, 1908, when Mitchell stepped down as UMW president, the union
    experienced a period of unsteady growth. Dues-paying membership fluctuated bteween 1904 and 1906
    because workers on strike could not contribute while unemployed. The depression of 1903
    pressured the union to accept a reduction in wages of five and one-half percent. In addition to
    widespread unemployment, strikes occurred when operators reduced wages further than the 1904
    joint agreement reached with operators in Pennsylvania, Ohio, indiana, and Illinois. The
    disputes in the anthracite region of eastern Pennsylvania were governed by a conciliation board
    established in 1903; often these disputes were not settled to the satisfaction of union members,
    and Mitchell noted apathy and a decline in membership in that region. He toured the region
    during the summer of 1905, and the rolls increased from 34,000 to 80,000. In August he addressed
    150,000 people at Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, with President Roosevelt on the platform. However,
    Mitchell foresaw imminent difficulties in eastern Pennsylvania as contracts were to expire in
    less than a year. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The annual January convention of mineworkers in 1906 set the strategy for a coming meeting
    with the operators. The three anthracite districts left the negotiating in the hands of a
    committee headed by Mitchell. A special convention formed ten demands for the upcoming joint
    interstate conference with the operators scheduled for February 2, 1906. At that meeting Patrick
    Dolan, president of district 5, voted against the instructions of his miners in favor of a
    resolution by the operators to extend the reduced wage scale for two years. He was the only
    labor leader to vote with the operators. The conference ended abruptly, with the operators
    clearly showing a stronger position against a divided union. This impasse was the most serious
    threat to the strength of the union since Mitchell had assumed office. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>In the next attempt to reach a settlement, H.C. Perry, president of the Illinois miners,
    introduced a resolution authorizing national and district officials to make two year agreements
    with any operator willing to restore the 1903 scale. This resolution in effect repudiated the
    policy of the previous decade of uniting the labor unions in the central competitive field until
    all the operators signed an agreement. Thomas Lewis of Ohio opposed the policy of district
    settlements, as he realized that operators in Ohio would not restore the 1903 scale unless
    forced to by the entire regional conference. After thorough discussion, Mitchell endorsed the
    policy and the Perry resolution was adopted by vote. Although much bitterness accompanied this
    decision, it proved to be a modest victory for the unions. By mid-April, 1906, most operators of
    unionized fields had signed the 1903 scale agreement and by mid-July, the rest of the operators
    submitted. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>During the January, 1907, convention, after Mitchell read his report concerning the previous
    year's activities, Vice President Lewis read a scathing criticism of the union's policies for
    1906. Lewis charged that the opportunity for an industry wide strike during a period of relative
    prosperity had been missed by the union. He also charged that, without desirable concessions,
    the sectional contracts caused declining morale and membership. Although Lewis was rebuked and
    Mitchell's action was endorsed by a committee report, the controversy continued. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>In April, 1907, Mitchell suffered an appendectomy from which he did not fully recover until
    June. Late that month he traveled west to Montana and Wyoming on UMW business. By October of
    that year, Mitchell was again in poor health, and as a result, announced that he would not stand
    for reelection. On March 19, 1908, he stepped down as president before an appreciative
    convention. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Mitchell accepted employment with the National Civic Federation in August, 1908. Organized in
    1900, the Federation sought to study and debate issues affecting United States' foreign and
    domestic policy, to mobilize enlightened public opinion on these issues, and to secure
    appropriate legislation relating to the same. While affiliated with this group, Mitchell was
    chairman of its Trade Agreement Department. In this capacity, he hoped to be able to bring about
    a better understanding by employers of the aims and methods of trade unionism. While he
    considered the work worthwhile, he did confide to Samuel Gompers that it was a bit of a letdown
    after his UMW endeavors. Unfortunately for Mitchell, the National Civic Federation was unpopular
    with many militant labor leaders because its membership included bitter foes of unionism. The
    radical element within the UMW continuously sought to persuade Mitchell to resign his position;
    they succeeded in 1911 when the union passed a resolution that made it a matter of expulsion for
    any UMW member to belong to the National Civic Federation. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Between 1911 and 1915, Mitchell was involved in the activities of the National Child Labor
    Committee, the American Academy of Political and Social Science, the American Association for
    Labor Legislation, New York Peace Society, National Committee on Prison Labor, Travelers' Aid
    Society, and the National Woman's Trade Union League. Also during this period he undertook
    extensive public speaking tours for the Lyceum and Chautauqua circuits and under the guidance of
    his own agent. In June, 1915, he was appointed by Governor Glynn as chairman of the New York
    State Industrial Commission, a post he held until his death in 1919. As chairman, Mitchell was
    frequently called on to investigate and arbitrate labor-management disputes. Mitchell's duties
    in this capacity included the prevention of violations of New York's labor laws and the
    administration of the Workmen's Compensation Law and the State Insurance Fund. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>During World War I, Mitchell carried the additional burden of the chairmanship of the New York
    State Food Commission. The Commission kept an eye on food production, offering advice on how to
    increase production and how to save food for the war effort, as well as opposing food price
    gouging and profiteering. Simultaneously, Mitchell was president of the New York State Council
    of Farms and Markets, chairman of the Federal Food Board, and chairman of the Federal Milk
    Commission for the eastern states. His last public appearance was in Syracuse before the New
    York State Federation of labor in August, 1919. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>In early August, 1919, Mitchell presided at a public hearing in the Rome brass and copper
    strike. After the bitterly contested hearing closed, he set out with friends on a vacation trip,
    but shortly after the trip began, he experienced a gall stone attack and returned to New York
    City for surgery. He died on September 9, 1919, following an operation at Post-Graduate
    Hospital. Funeral services were conducted at the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Diocese of
    Scranton, Pennsylvania, at which city his remains were interred.</p>

   <head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
   <p>The papers of John Mitchell contain correspondence (1885-1919), reports and proceedings,
    pamphlets, and photographs primarily in connection with Mitchell's leading role in the
    coal-mining industry, the labor movement, and in American industrial relations. </p>
   <p>Correspondence constitutes the bulk of the collection. It can be divided roughly into three
    major areas, reflecting Mitchell's affiliations with the United Mine Workers of America, the
    National Civic Federation, and New York State Commissions. There is much correspondence relating
    to the affairs of the American Federation of Labor, as well. </p>
   <p>Other significant files include minutes of the United Mine Workers National Executive Board
    (1900-1908), A.F.of L. Executive Council minutes (1902-1913), and those of the New York State
    Food Commission (1917-1919) the New York State Workman's Compensation Commission (1914-1919) and
    the New York State Industrial Commission (1914-1919).</p>
