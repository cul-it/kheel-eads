			<p>The Railway Labor Act [RLA], which applies to employees of interstate rail and air
				carriers, was amended in 1951 to add a union shop provision [Section 2, Eleventh].
				Prior to 1951, the RLA did not have this clause, but rather specified that union
				membership could not be a requirement to employment nor were union-dues check-offs
				allowed. This was to curb the possibility of company controlled labor organizations
				serving as bargaining agents with themselves at the expense of the employees. By
				1951, these company dominated unions were no longer a factor, and after lobbying by
				railroad labor groups, the above mentioned amendment was added to the RLA,
				empowering unions to enter into union shop agreements with railroad carriers. The
				amendment to the RLA reads, in part, that labor organizations "shall be
				permitted...to make agreements, requiring, as a condition of continued employment,
				that within 60 days the beginning of such employment all employees shall become
				members of the labor organization representing their craft or class" [Section 2,
				Eleventh (a)]. In addition to allowing the union shop, the amendment also explicitly
				stated that this amendment superseded any laws or statutes passed at the local or
				state level. However, the amendment did not repeal the prior injunction against
				union shop; it merely superseded it. This is in contrast to the Taft-Hartley Act,
				which allows individual states to impose more stringent measures against unions. At
				the time of the amendment to the RLA, there were eighteen states with right to work
				laws that outlawed union shop agreements; eleven of these were in the South. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1953, Union Pacific Railroad Company [UP] entered into a union shop agreement with
				sixteen labor unions. The plaintiffs, Robert L. Hanson and other non-union employees
				of UP, sued the company and the labor unions in a district court in Nebraska to halt
				the union shop agreement because Nebraska has a right to work clause in its state
				constitution. The plaintiffs argued that in addition to being unconstitutional
				under the state constitution, they would suffer irreperable injury by being forced
				to pay dues, fees, and assessments to an organization they were being compelled to
				join. Conversely, the unions argued that these employees, dubbed "free riders,"
				enjoyed all the benefits the unions achieved for employees through collective
				bargaining without paying their share of the costs of conducting those bargaining
				agreements. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p> The district court judge issued the injunction and in 1954 found in favor of the
				plaintiffs. The unions appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Nebraska which, in
				an opinion written by Justice Adolph Wenke, upheld the lower court's decision. The
				labor unions then appealled the case to the United States Supreme Court. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The United States Supreme Court found the union shop provision of the RLA
				constitutional. Justice Douglas wrote in his opinion, "We only hold that the
				requirement for financial support of the collective-bargaining agency by all who
				receive the benefits of its work is within the power of Congress under the Commerce
				Clause." </p>

			<p>Inclusive date range: 1955-1956 </p>
			<p>Bulk date: 1955 </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>This collection consists of the released opinion of the Supreme Court of Nebraska in
				the case of Hanson v. Union Pacific Railroad Company [160 Neb. 669, 71 N.W. (2d) 526
				(1955)], fourteen amicus briefs filed with the United States Supreme Court by
				various enitities after the suit was successfully appealed, the brief Robert L.
				Hanson and his fellow individual appellees filed with the Supreme Court, and an
				article written by J. A. McClain, Jr., dean of the School of Law of Duke University
				on the ruling of the Supreme Court. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The opinion of the Nebraska Supreme Court was written by Justice Adolph Wenke and
				found in favor of the plaintiffs. Amicus briefs were filed by other individuals
				opposed to union shops, organizations that supported right to work legislation, and
				individual American states and commonwealths that had right to work laws. The
				organizations represented in the amicus briefs are the American Farm Bureau
				Federation , the National Right to Work Committee, the National Association of
				Manufacturers, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, and the Southern States
				Industrial Council. The states and commonwealths who filed amicus briefs are South
				Carolina, Virginia, Texas, South Dakota, and Utah; Nebraska, Florida, and
				Mississippi filed their brief jointly.</p>
