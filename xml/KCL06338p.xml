			<p>David P. Miller was born in Cleveland, Ohio on June 21, 1919. After serving nearly five years in the US Army during World War II he received a BS from the University of Arizona in 1948. This degree was followed by an MBA from the University of
				California at Berkeley in 1950. </p>
			<p>After a brief employment by the US Department of Labor as a wage economist in 1950 Miller became an Impartial Manager for the Ford-UAW retirement board, a position he held until his death. He was also an Associate Umpire for Ford and the UAW
				from 1952 to 1959, and the Ad Hoc S.U.B. Plan Chairman from 1958 on. Unfortunately the Ford-UAW representatives decided not to cite Associate Umpire awards in their arbitrations, only Umpire awards. This meant that Miller's roughly 1,000
				memorandum decisions never served as precedents in later cases. </p>
			<p>Miller served as an Umpire and Arbitrator for US Steel and the United Steelworkers of America from 1962 on. He was also an Umpire for the Aluminum Company of America (ALCO) and the Aluminum Workers International Union (1965 on), the Budd Company
				and the UAW (1971 on), and the Borroughs Corporation and the UAW (1964-1965). By his estimate he wrote about 2,000 Umpire decisions. </p>
			<p>His ad hoc arbitration dealt mostly with newspaper and communication workers. Some of the unions involved were the CWA, OCAW, Pressmen, Typographers, IBEW, and Machinists. By his estimate he wrote about 1,000 ad hoc decisions. </p>
			<p>Miller was a member and on the arbitration panels of the American Academy of Arbitrators and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. He was a member of the Industrial Relations Research Association, the Society of Professionals in
				Dispute Resolution (SPIDR), and the National Academy of Arbitrators (NAA). Miller served the NAA in several capacities: Executive Secretary (1962-1968), member of the Board of Governors (1968-1971), Vice-President (1972-1973), President-Elect
				(1973-1974), and President (1974-1975). </p>
			<p>David P. Miller died of a heart attack, in Detroit, Michigan, on March 22, 1975 at the age of 55.</p>
