						<p>Dick, Photo Artist, Cape Vincent, N.Y. [photographer]. Gelatin silver print, ca. 1900?. Image depicts the elaborate house called Wyckoff Villa on the reverse of this photo, but better known as Carleton Villa on Carleton Island, one
							of the thousand islands near Cape Vincent, N.Y. The house is a four-story combination of stone and timber construction with Tudor touches, and a tower in the rear. The villa was completed in 1894 and owned by the Wyckoff family,
							although written on the reverse of this photo is: "Johnson Summer Home, 1000 Islands nr. Cape Vincent, N.Y." referring to the William G. Johnson family, founder of the William G. Johnson Company, aka Johnson Dye Wood Company, in
							Uncasville, Conn. A history of the house does not indicate when the Johnsons owned it. As of 2003, the house was derelict and had been abandoned for over 70 years. See

							slightly visible on the left. The villa was completed in 1894 and owned by the Wyckoff family, but at some point was the summer home of the Johnson family, referring to the William G. Johnson family, founder of the William G.
