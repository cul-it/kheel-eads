   <p>Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities in the
    northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size, political
    influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized labor by mid-century.
    Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and
    living conditions of its members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs,
    health care facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. In
    1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form
    the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE).</p>
  </bioghist>
  <bioghist encodinganalog="MARC 545">
   <p>Vanni B. Montana (Giovanni Buscemi) was born February 12, 1902 in Mazara del Vallo in
    southwestern Sicily. As a socialist in a growing fascist state, Montana fled his native land as
    a political refugee finding himself first in Vienna, before heading to Berlin and settling in
    Paris. On his travels, Montana came in contact and befriended other Italian anti-fascists and
    socialists. During his time in France, he took classes, worked with Italian immigrants, and he
    helped organize and unionize laborers, diggers, and restaurant workers, arranging strikes and
    giving speeches. On July 4, 1928, Montana immigrated to the United States and soon found himself
    surrounded by the Italian-American community and antifascists, becoming employed by the
    newspapers "Il Lavoratore" and "Il Nuovo Mondo" (later "La Stampa Libera"). He became involved
    in the Italian socialist movement, organizing rallies against fascism and urging opposition
    against Mussolini. After the war, Montana was active in the rebuilding of a democratic Italy,
    and organized one of the first people to people tourism programs to bring Italian immigrants and
    their American born children to the country. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Montana was a co-founder of the Italian-American Labor Council in 1941, and helped draft the
    petition to exempt Italian citizens living in the United States from the "enemy aliens"
    category. For thirty-four years, he was an editor of "Giustizia," the Italian publication of the
    International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, as well as the Education Director of ILGWU Local
    89 and worked on the "Voice of Local 89" radio program. Montana died in 1991 at the age of
    89.</p>

  <scopecontent encodinganalog="MARC 520">
   <p>The collection contains the typed manuscript for Vanni B. Montana's autobiography, "The
    Shambles: Broken Bridges over the Seas," from 1977. The "Shambles" is the English version of his
    Italian language autobiography "Amarostico" which is currently available at over a dozen public
    and academic libraries. Montana interweaves historical events in his hometown of Mazara del
    Vallo and Sicily with episodes from his youth, illustrating how the political climate and early
    experiences would influence him later in life. The first section recounts not just life in
    Sicily, but topics such as socialism, antifascism, communism, and the individuals Montana met as
    a student and the thoughts and ideas debated among his circle. As fascism grew, Montana found it
    difficult to remain in his home and country and details his experiences escaping and becoming a
    political refugee. After immigrating to the U.S., he found himself surrounded by like-minded
    individuals and aligned himself with the Italian-American community. He discusses his various
    jobs and organizations he was involved with, including his work with the ILGWU and Local 89, the
    founding of the Italian-American Labor Council, and his trips to Italy after the war. Montana's
    manuscript reflects his interest and activities as an Italian-American labor leader and
    socialist. Researchers may be interested in the organizations discussed including: the Italian
    Socialist Party (PSI), the Socialist Party of Italian Workers (PSLI), the Italian Socialist
    Federation of the American Socialist Party, the Mazzini Society, the Italian-American Victory
    Council, the Italian-American Labor Council, the Office of War Information (OWI), the
    Amalgamated Clothing Workers Of America (ACWA) and the International Ladies' Garment Workers'
    Union (ILGWU). Notable individuals mentioned in Montana's manuscript include: Carlo Tresca,
    Sidney Hillman, Luigi Antonini, Generoso Pope, Augusto Bellanca, Giuseppe Modigliani and Ignazio
    Silone. The Vanni Buscemi Montana Collection located at the George Meany Archives contains
    correspondence, writings and clippings that Montana amassed to write his autobiography.</p>
