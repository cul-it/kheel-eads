			<p>The New York City Transit Board was established in 1924 as the operating agency for
				the New York City mass transit system. In 1932, the Transit Board completed the
				construction of the Independent Subway [IND] and its employees became part of the
				Competitive Civil Service System in 1935. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>There were two private companies providing subway service in New York at this time:
				the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Company [BRT] and the Interborough Rapid Transit
				Company [IRT]. Their employees had negotiated system-wide closed shop agreements
				with the Transport Workers' Union [TWU] in 1937, except for motormen and signal
				maintainers. They were represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers [BLE]
				and the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen [BRS], respectively. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1940, New York City purchased the BMT and the IRT and as part of the purchase
				agreed to respect the contracts of the three unions, which were set to expire in
				1941. However, the relationship between the City and the unions degenerated and the
				TWU made two separate strike threats. The mayor of New York, William O'Dwyer,
				eventually responded to these threats by creating the Mayor's Advisory Transit
				Committee in 1946. The committee was charged with studying the issues and making
				recommendations regarding working conditions, wages, and labor relations with the
				NYC Transit Board. The chairman of the board was Arthur S. Meyer. The other members
				of the committee were Theodore W. Kheel, Edward P. Mulrooney, Anna M. Hoffman (nee
				Rosenberg), and Samuel I. Rosenman. Dr. Thomas Knowlton, United States Conciliation
				Service, and Clara Friedman (nee Handleman), labor arbitrator, served as executive
				secretary and committee economist, respectively. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The central issues addressed were the desirabiliity and permissibility of collective
				bargaining, the process for resolving grievances, the legality of public employees
				striking, and monetary issues concerning both wages and maintenance of an extensive
				transit system. Hearings were held in the spring and summer of 1946. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The final report of the committee was delivered to Mayor O'Dwyer on September 9,
				1946.</p>

			<p>Inclusive date range: 1937 -1947 </p>
			<p>Bulk date: 1946 </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>This collection consists of records submitted to and created by the New York City's
				Mayor's Advisory Committee. The collection is divided into four series, listed
				below, to help distinguish the creators of the records in this collection. "Series
				I: Hearing Transcripts" consists of fourteen bound volumes conaining the transcripts
				of the thirteen public hearings held in March, April, and May 1946 and for the
				hearing in June 1946 held with the Board of Transportation. "Series II: Union
				Exhibits and Submissions" consists of memoranda, demands, briefs, supplemental
				briefs, exhibits, and other submissions made by the sixteen unions representing the
				employees in the NYC Transit System. In addition to the records of these sixteen
				organizations which appeared at the hearings, this series also conatins the briefs of
				an additional seven labor orgnizations which did not participate in the hearings, but
				did file their papers with the Committee (for a complete list of these organiations,
				see pp. iii-iv in the final report of the Committee). "Series III: Board of
				Transportation Exhibits and Submissions" consists of the Board of Transportation
				[BoT] response to the demands of its employees in a memorandum with exhibits and
				additional submissions with data that the BoT alleged supported their position in
				denying the demands of their employees. "Series IV: Mayor's Committee Drafts,
				Correspondence, and Reports" consists of the records generated by the Committee
				itself. These papers include multiple drafts of the final report submitted to the
				Mayor, detailed analysis of monetary matters and labor relations with regard to
				civil service employees in other municipalities as they relate to the demands of the
				employees, annotated copies of civil service laws, correspondence between committee
				members, and a copy of the final published report of the Mayor's Advisory Transit
				Committee. </p>
