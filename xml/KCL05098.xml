            <p>The New York State Board of Mediation and Arbitration was requested by the Iron
                Moulders Union to make an inquiry into the cause of the dispute between the Moulders
                and the Acme Malleable Iron Works. The Board held a hearing in Buffalo on February
                21, 1899, since it had been informed that a condition of lawlessness existed around
                the plant and extra police were needed to guard the plant. </p>
            <p>The strike, or lockout began when the union presented its demands for $2.25 a day for
                the men on day work and piece rates which would permit the men to earn at least
                $2.25 a day. Shortly after the demands were presented, the employer called the
                moulders together in the plant to tell them that he was discharging all union men
                because they were intimidating non-union men and causing trouble in the plant. The
                non-union men could continue working, however. Union and non-union men walked off
                the job. </p>
            <p>In the course of the hearings it became apparent that the men were unable to learn
                the price for the jobs they did until payday, that they felt the weights assigned by
                the foreman were not always accurate and that the foreman gave the better jobs to
                the men who paid him extra. Union members also believed that they were discriminated
                against. The foreman denied the charges against him.</p>
