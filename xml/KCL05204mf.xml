   <p>The Southern Tenant Farmers' Union (STFU), a biracial union of sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and small landowners, came into existence in the cotton plantation country of Arkansas in July, 1934, under the leadership of a group of socialists, including
    H.L. Mitchell and Howard Kester. Although locals were soon established in Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama, the union's base of operation remained in Arkansas until 1945. </p>
   <p>Farm mechanization and the impact of World War II shifted the union's focus from tenant farmers to migrant farm workers, whose numbers were rapidly increasing. The union also began supplying temporary cannery workers during the 1940's. </p>
   <p>From 1937 to 1939, the STFU was affiliated with the CIO through the United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing and Allied Workers of America (UCAPAWA). After the STFU's withdrawal from the CIO in response to ideological differences with the UCAPAWA, it
    remained independent until it secured direct affiliation with the A.F. of L. in 1946. At that time, the organization's name changed to the National Farm Labor Union (NFLU) and organizing efforts shifted to farm workers in California. During the 1950's, the
    NFLU's successor, the National Agricultural Workers' Union (NAWU), focused on organizing sugar, rice, and strawberry workers in Louisiana. </p>
   <p>In 1960, the NAWU surrendered its AFL-CIO charter and merged with the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen. H.L. Mitchell, former secretary of the SFTU, headed Local 300 of the Allied and Agricultural Workers' Union, organizing rice mill workers
    and fishermen in Louisiana.</p>

      <p>Only two folders of papers survive from this year. There is a copy of the union's first Constitution, as well as the Constitution of the Oklahoma Renters Union upon which the STFU document was based. The papers include a report by Mitchell on the
       union's activities during 1934, an STFU "Program of Action", and The Plight of the Sharecropper, a booklet by Norman Thomas (note: this is the original edition. A copy of the revised edition appears in the selection from the Howard A. Kester Papers on
       Reel 59). There are a few pieces of correspondence with the AAA and with Donald Henderson of the National Conference of Agricultural, Lumber and Rural Workers.</p>

       Department of Agriculture. There are a number of statements, press releases, and letters related to the Rodgers case. There is also a great deal of correspondence from Norman Thomas; see especially his exchange with Secretary of Agriculture Henry A.
       Wallace (April 16). Readers interested in the union's activities during 1935 should consult the selection from the Howard A. Kester Papers on Reel 59 for additional materials.</p>

      <p>Correspondence during may Concerns the Controversy within the AAA over Section 7a of the Cotton Contract; see especially a letter from Norman Thomas describing his recent conversation with President Roosevelt on this subject (May 8). There is an
       exchange of letters with union lawyer CT Carpenter and the ACLU on the advisability of further legal action against Arkansas planters to counter eviction of tenants. The STFU experienced troubles within the ranks of its own leadership and was forced to
       expel both WH Stultz and J.O. Green. On the expulsions, see the injunction obtained against Stultz (June 17), an affidavit sworn by Stultz affirming his dire poverty (June 27) and the Constitution of Green's Fascist-style "Tenant Farmers' and Labors'
       Patriotic Union" (July 19). There is also an interesting communication from the Alabama Share Croppers Union on Green's attempt to subvert their strike. The papers for September include press releases, leaflets, etc. relating to the strike of cotton
       pickers called by the union in eastern Arkansas.</p>

      <p>The Second Annual STFU Convention was held at Little Rock on January 3 to 5; the papers include the program, press releases, the "report of the Second Annual Convention," the Report of the Executive Secretary for 1935; and "Ceremony of the Land" by
       Howard Kester. There is a good deal of material concerning the union's attempt to gain representation at a conference called by Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace on the future of the AAA (Jan. 8 to 15). Another major topic is the situation at
       Parkin, Arkansas, where a mass eviction of tenants at the C.H. Dibble plantation was followed by the violent disruption of a union meeting in the adjacent town of Earle and the erection of a tent colony to shelter the homeless families. Lastly, there is
       much correspondence with women STFU members on the decision by the convention to create separate locals for women.</p>

       Resettlement Administration concerning a projected cooperative farm for displaced tenants (18, 21, 29). Toward the end of the month, a frequent topic in the correspondence is the case of Jim Ball, a black STFU organizer convicted of "intent to kill" a
       deputy sheriff during the violence at Earle in January; see especially the STFU brief before the Arkansas Supreme Court appealing Ball's case (26).</p>

       Jackson's National Committee on Rural Social Planning (31). Other items of special interest include Kester's pamphlet, Revolt of the Sharecroppers (17), Mitchell's preliminary instructions to his locals on a forthcoming strike (9,19), and Mitchell's
       widespread appeals for financial help for the union, including letters to two of his friends in New Orleans explaining in detail the philosophy of the STFU (23). </p>

       include a frequent exchange of letters between Mitchell and STFU Vice-President E.B. McKinney on McKinney's fund-raising trip to New York and on his complaints of mistreatment by his fellow STFU officers. There is a mimeographed letter from Mitchell to
       all locals on strike preparations (18) and a letter from Mitchell to Norman Thomas on reports that Donald Henderson was attempting to undermine the STFU leadership (27).</p>

       daily communications with Gardner Jackson. Toward the end of May, a major issue developed in the case of Paul Peacher, a Crittenden County (Ark.) Deputy Sheriff accused of holding sharecroppers in peonage on his penal farm; see especially the union
       press release, "Concentration Camps in Arkansas" (21).</p>

      <p>The strike and the violence mounted by the planters to break the strike are the main issues in the papers for June. The papers include several STFU press releases on the strike and a considerable amount of correspondence between Mitchell and union
       members on the expenditure of strike relief funds. Friends of the union also sent STFU headquarters copies of their letters to state and Federal officials protesting the unchecked violence. There is also a discussion of plans to send a sharecropper
       delegation to picket Franklin D. Roosevelt on his visit to Little Rock (3 to 10). On the problems of raising funds for legal defense, see especially two letters from Professor William R. Amberson (23,37).</p>

      <p>Several STFU members faced legal charges in the aftermath of the strike, and Gardner Jackson kept union headquarters informed of his efforts to raise bail money (6,10,28). The ACLU sent a copy of their letter to Arkansas governor J.M. Funtrell listing
       a number of cases in which the civil rights of union members were allegedly violated (8), while J.C. Brookfield, a union lawyer, and the WDL sent reports on the cases of Nathan Smith and Josh Turner, both held on felony charges in Crittenden County
       (23,30). STFU Vice-President E.B. McKinney, in hiding from the Memphis police, wrote frequently about his poverty and the mistreatment of blacks by white STFU leaders; see also Mitchell's reply (31). Also of special interest in July is a set of three
       "test letters", addressing black union members by title, sent out in an attempt to catch local postmasters who refused to deliver mail addressed in this fashion (5,7 -- see also an explanatory note by Mitchell at this date).</p>

      <p>Topics under discussion during August include plans to send former STFU leader Walter Moskop to California after his attempt to assassinate H.L. Mitchell, the forthcoming Socialist Party campaign in Arkansas, a training school for union organizers
       held at the Delta Cooperative Farm beginning August 17, legal defense problems, and the discussion of STFU tactics toward Governor Futrell's planned Commission on Farm Tenancy. There is a letter from Mitchell to Donald Henderson protesting Henderson's
       editorial in The Rural Worker (12) and an exchange between Mitchell and Gardner Jackson on whether the STFU should concentrate on building its internal structure or on gaining national publicity (11,12).</p>

      <p>Governor Futrell's Commission on Farm Tenancy met at Hot Springs on September 21; see the STFU Statement to the Commission which appears on that date. Other topics in the papers include the speaking tours of Socialist Party candidates Norman Thomas
       and George A. Nelson, including Thomas' Memphis speech entitled "Arkansas Shame" (17), the STFU claim that WPA officials were dropping workers from the relief rolls in an attempt to drive down Arkansas plantation wages, and arrangements with the Workers
       Defense League (formerly the Labor and Socialist Defense Committee) to handle STFU legal problems. There are letters from union members A.B. Brookins and J.F. Lee, recounting the violence they have experienced (7).</p>

      <p>The first half of the month was relatively quiet for the STFU. The union filed a Supplementary Statement to Gov. Futrell's Commission (10), and a similar commission in Oklahoma issued a report of its proceedings (22). Mitchell wrote organizer Roy
       Morelock to explain the new system of record keeping adopted by the union (13). During the second half of October, two major issues developed: the complaint of organizer L.N. Sybert that white union officials were not fair in their treatment of black
       members, and the charges made by US District Attorney Fred Isgrig concerning an STFU fund-raising letter sent out by the Workers Defense League in New York (24, 29 to 31). The papers include a letter from Mitchell to the WDL listing the status of the
       various court cases the union was currently involved in (21); a mimeographed letter from Howard Kester to the union membership explaining the work of the Central Defense Committee and appealing to them for funds (26); an AF of L resolution endorsing the
       STFU (28); and a "Calendar of Events" describing the battles of the STFU from the strike of May 18 through the Isgrig incident in October (n.d.[October]).</p>

      <p>There is considerable correspondence concerning the Isgrig statement during the first half of the month, including a copy of a letter from Isgrig to Aron S. Gilmartin, head of the WDL (3). Other items of interest include: a letter from Mitchell to
       Norman Thomas, describing his recent meeting in Tampa, Florida, with Gardner Jackson and Donald Henderson in an attempt to iron out the differences between Henderson and the STFU (17); a report from Ward Rodgers on a lettuce workers strike in the
       Salinas Valley, Calif. (8); an open letter to President Roosevelt from the STFU (20); and three letters from Rev. Claude Williams on his proposal to start a training school for STFU organizers (19,23,26). Although Deputy Sheriff Paul D. Peacher was
       convicted of peonage during the last week of November, there is little in the papers relating to the case, except for a congratulatory note from Norman Thomas (25).</p>

      <p>The papers for this month are primarily concerned with preparations for events scheduled to take place in January, including the STFU Annual Convention held at Muskogee, Okla., on Jan. 14 to 17, the Southern meeting of the Socialist Party at Norris,
       Tenn., on Jan. 2 and 3, and the public hearings of the President's Special Commission on Farm Tenancy, held at Dallas, Texas, and Montgomery, Alabama, on Jan. 4 and 6, respectively. At the beginning of December, the Workers Defense League sent Aaron
       Levenstein to STFU headquarters in Memphis to help with legal defense and fund-raising. Levenstein's almost daily correspondence with Sidney Hertzberg in the New York office of WDL provides much information on plans to initiate a National Sharecroppers
       Week and the "Friends of the STFU". Other items include: a prospectus for an organizers training school set up by Claude Williams at Little Rock on Dec. 13 to 22 (13); a letter of apology from Donald Henderson for his editorial in The Rural Worker (21);
       and the minutes of the Oklahoma Farm Tenancy Committee (19 and 31).</p>

      <p> The year began with public hearings of the President's Special Commission on Farm Tenancy at Dallas and Montgomery. The papers include the STFU statements at both hearings, as well as memoranda to the commission from Odis Sweeden and Fred Matthews,
       STFU leaders in Oklahoma and Texas, respectively (4 to 6). Virtually all of the papers near the middle of the month have to do with the Muskogee Convention, including the "Auditors' Preliminary Report to the Convention", the convention program, Howard
       Kester's "Ceremony of the Land", revised for the Muskogee meeting, the "Proceedings of the Third Annual Convention" (in both printed and typescript form), and telegrams to the convention from many high-placed government and labor officials. Following
       the convention, there is considerable correspondence concerning a supposed agreement reached at Muskogee between Mitchell and David Fowler, a UMWA official, to cut ties between the STFU and Commonwealth College. See especially a copy of a letter from
       Claude Williams to Gardner Jackson, vehemently attacking the alleged bargain (23), and two letters from Howard Kester to Roger Baldwin, explaining the problems at the college and Mitchell's actions (8, 28).</p>

      <p> The Mississippi River overflowed its banks at the beginning of the month, and much of the correspondence concerns flood relief for union members. Following the Muskogee convention, union activity in the Southwest accelerated, and there is a great
       amount of communication with such leaders as Odis Sweeden and John M. Denney in Oklahoma and Fred Matthews and J.R. Freeland in Texas. Much of the correspondence with Sweeden and Denney concerns the supposed Mitchell-Fowler-Jackson bargain at Muskogee
       (4,12,15). About the middle of the month, two black union members in Forrest City, Ark. were murdered and the lawyers sent to investigate were run out of town.</p>

       Violence and legal troubles flared up again in May, including the arrest of organizer J.F. Hynds for calling a strike of 200 WPA workers on a highway project near Forrest City and the disruption of union meetings in Caruthersville, Mo. and Mississippi
       County, Ark.</p>

       detailed letters from Socialist Party Labor Secretary Frank Trager on the situation (17,30), as well as the correspondence with Henderson himself. The CIO proposal was the main item on the agenda of an especially important NEC meeting held June 20; the

      <p> Routine correspondence with UCAPAWA headquarters begins the first week of August. Mitchell explained the new affiliation to the STFU membership and the new operating procedures to his organizers in mimeographed letters (5,21). The union began
       preparations for a special convention to ratify the UCAPAWA affiliation and for a series of local strikes to demand higher wages for cotton picking, both slated for September. To avert further violence against the union, J.R. Butler began sending
       telegrams to Arkansas Governor Carl Bailey, informing him of threats made against union meetings (6,20). Other items of special interest include: an exchange between Butler and Kester, working out their personal differences (18,20); Mitchell to
       organizer Lee Phillips on STFU policy toward union activity in Mississippi (24); J.E. Clayton, a black STFU organizer from Texas, to Mitchell on getting black workers in the South into the CIO (29); and Mitchell to Aubrey Williams, reporting on his

       Louisiana organizer for the National Farmers Union, wrote to urge Mitchell to begin organizing Louisiana sugar workers (7,14,24) and the New Orleans Industrial Union Council seconded the proposal (23): see also Mitchell's lengthy reply, detailing his
       plans for organizing all southern workers under UCAPAWA (8). Anti-union violence continued with a mob attack on J.R. Butler and the disruption of union meetings in Missouri. A letter sent to the WDL provides a listing of all legal cases currently
       pending (7). There is an interesting letter from Arthur G. McDowell, the new Labor Secretary of the Socialist Party, setting forth his plans (23), and a copy of a set of correspondence from the ACLU on the beating of UAW organizer Norman Smith in

       At Blytheville, local planters forcibly prevented cotton pickers from working on adjacent plantations for higher wages; in addition to considerable correspondence with the leaders of the union in Blytheville, there are 4 affidavits (13) and statements
       from town residents (15). There is a series of detailed letters between STFU and UCAPAWA headquarters, trying to iron out administrative problems (6,8,9,11,19), as well as a number of letters from Mitchell to local STFU officials explaining the new
       administrative procedure (19 to 29). In this connection, see also the nine-page typewritten memorandum from Gardner Jackson to the CIO on the STFU (1). Throughout October and November, there is an especially heavy volume of correspondence between J.R.
       Butler and various union members, dealing mainly with their personal problems. Finally, there is an affidavit of a black union member refused the vote even though he had paid his poll tax (25)</p>

      <p> Blytheville and Forrest City continued to dominate STFU concern during November. The union attempted to convince the U.S. Department of Justice to initiate a peonage case at Forrest City, but had little luck with District Attorney Fred A. Isgrig
       (16), or his superiors in Washington (Dec. 6). The STFU National Executive Committee met on Nov. 20; the minutes may be found in the Howard A. Kester Papers, Reel 59. There is a detailed letter from Butler to Kester, enumerating the issues to be
       discussed at the meeting (17) and a report to the NEC from Evelyn Smith on the change-over to UCAPAWA administrative routine (20). Also of interest: an affidavit by Mitchell, describing threats made against him by Memphis police chief Will D. Lee (2); a
       report from George Lambert on his organizing work in Houston and on interference from the Communist Party (11); and a mimeographed letter from Mitchell to all STFU locals informing them of a union survey to determine how many members need WPA relief

       several individual items of particular interest: a letter to the ACLU on the case of Laurent Frantz, a representative of the People's Rights Committee arrested in Memphis (8); a letter from Barney Egan, Regional Director of the CIO, describing a meeting
       of black farmers held at Littig, Texas by J.E. Clayton (17), and one from Clayton, suggesting strategy for organizing black workers in the South (28); a call for an emergency session of the NEC to act on reports of internal subversion of locals in Cross

      <p>The national setback in the New Deal recovery program resulted in an especially hard winter for the union's members, and there is heavy correspondence between STFU leaders and both state and Federal agencies seeking help for poverty-stricken families.
       In conjunction with this effort, the STFU undertook several surveys to determine the extent of the need for relief, including a survey of evictions (15) and a survey of union members refused WPA work relief (appears at the end of the month). Mitchell
       travelled to Washington with the preliminary results of the 1937 survey (see folder 225 above) in hand and reported on his trip to Butler (4 and 5). Internal dissension developed within the union, both in Oklahoma and Arkansas. The Oklahoma State
       Executive Committee listed its complaints (13) and Mitchell tried to straighten things out by correspondence with Odis Sweeden (14 to 16) and by a visit to a special STFU meeting on unemployment in Oklahoma (23 and 24). Late in the month, a group in
       Cross County, Arkansas formed the wild-cat "Arkansas Agricultural and Labor Association" and J.R. Butler responded with a hard-hitting circular letter to all STFU locals (28). There is also a summary of per capita tax paid to UCAPAWA by the STFU from
       October to December, 1937 (1); a "report to the International Executive Board, UCAPAWA" from Donald Henderson (18); and a copy of a letter from Barney Egan to his fellow CIO leader John Brophy on trouble between the Texas Pecan Shellers Union and
       UCAPAWA (26)</p>

       by the convention; a typescript of the convention proceedings; "The Southern Tenant Farmers' Union in 1937", a report by H.L. Mitchell; and "One Bread, One Body", a play in three scenes by Lee Hays and Dan Burnett. All of these items are filed under the
       date of Feb. 25. In addition to the correspondence concerning the convention, there is a frequent exchange of letters between the STFU and Harriet Young of the WDL, planning for National Sharecroppers Week. There is some discussion of the Cross County
       wild-cat movement at the beginning of the month, including a detailed report from local leader Myrtle Lawrence (7). A new problem developed in Jefferson County, Ark., where STFU officials Claude Williams, Leon Turner, and E.B. McKinney attempted to
       reorganize the union in violation of STFU procedure. In this connection, see especially the report from J.W. Dillard (13) and Mitchell to Leon Turner (28). Finally, there is a reply from WPA on STFU complaints of union members refused relief work (24)
       and documents concerning three union members in the FSA program evicted from their homes (23)</p>

      <p>National Sharecroppers Week was held from March 6 to 13; papers relating to it include a WDL leaflet (6), a report from Butler to Harriet Young on his NSW trip to the Mid-west (17), and a statement of receipts and disbursements from the WDL (29).
       Trouble continued in Jefferson County, and Ark. organizer D.A. Griffin reported on it at length (28). The STFU sent a copy of an anti-war resolution passed at its convention to a number of US Senators (24) and several replied (29 and 30). Other items of
       interest include: two press releases on the Texas Pecan Shellers Union strike in San Antonio (2, 19); two letters from Mitchell to organizers Steve Lucas and Fred Matthews on the status of the union in Mississippi and Texas, respectively (9,20); a
       dispute between Mitchell and Donald Henderson over dues payments (19, 23); correspondence with Harriet Young on a proposed WDL campaign against peonage (25 to 28); a long letter from lawyer C.A. Stanfield reviewing the various legal cases pending for
       the union (29); Mitchell to Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace, complaining about planter violations of the 1938 cotton control program (30); and Evelyn Smith to Donald Henderson, explaining why all letters sent to STFU members must be mailed in
       plain envelopes without any use of titles in the address (2).</p>

      <p> The tensions between the STFU and UCAPAWA intensified into a full-scale battle during April and May, with key STFU leaders determined to take their organization out of the International. One can trace this development in the papers, beginning with
       the call for an emergency meeting of the NEC (18), and continuing with the Minutes of the Convention of the Oklahoma STFU, which passed a special resolution on affiliation with UCAPAWA (23). There is a 2-page typescript, giving a brief history of the
       relations between the STFU and UCAPAWA (25), apparently related to the NEC emergency session, for which full Minutes appear (25). Finally, there is an incomplete set of Minutes of the International Executive Board meeting marked "Not Released" (29).
       Complaints to WPA over the work relief program continued (5, 14), and the agency replied to one earlier STFU complaint (19). Mitchell also telegrammed Secretary Henry A. Wallace again about the unfair cotton contracts circulating in the Delta (4), and
       Sam Franklin at the DCF sent the union further information on these contracts (7)</p>

      <p> The fight with UCAPAWA began to heat up, and the reader may follow its progress through the letters which Mitchell wrote to his friends and allies, keeping them informed of events and outlining strategy. Other documents relating to the split include:
       a mimeographed letter to STFU locals, explaining the conflict with UCAPAWA (11; note: page 2 of this letter is missing); Minutes of a special NEC meeting which voted to withdraw from the International (21); "An Open Letter to the American Labor
       Movement....", announcing the NEC vote (21); a mimeographed letter from Henderson to STFU locals, enclosing an incomplete set of minutes for the UCAPAWA Board meeting (23); and Mitchell to Henderson, complaining that the minutes are incomplete (30). In
       addition to the materials on the split with UCAPAWA, there are a few items which shed light on the situation in Jefferson County, where trouble broke out in February (2,13). Finally, there is a copy of a "Statement to the Worker's Defense League" from
       _Millie Sue Blagden, informing them that she is dropping her celebrated flogging case and joining the Communist Party (20)</p>

      <p> STFU leaders met with Henderson in Washington at the beginning of the month to iron out their differences. Henderson sent the union his understanding of the agreement finally reached (4), but Mitchell reported on the status of the negotiations to the
       members of the NEC (8), and, when the problems were settled, he sent out a circular letter to all STFU locals explaining that the STFU would retain its affiliation with UCAPAWA (27). Henderson's reply to Mitchell's complaints appears on July 29. The
       union continued to document cases of peonage in Arkansas by collecting affidavits (6,18,19,23); letters to the WDL supply additional information on the investigation (7,24). Two STFU projects got underway during June: A YM-YWCA project to bring
       students, both white and black, into Arkansas to give them firsthand knowledge of the lives of sharecroppers, and a project to organize the "Friends of the STFU" as part of the union's fund-raising effort</p>

      <p> Mitchell represented the STFU on the President's National Emergency Council in Washington; the papers include his statement (5) and a report to Butler on his trip (6). Two weeks later, a letter went out to members of the NEC informing them that black
       STFU Vice-President E.B. McKinney was attempting to split the union along racial lines (18). McKinney, writing to Wiley Harris, a black organizer, claimed on the contrary that white leaders had no concern for the welfare of black members (29). Mitchell
       wrote two long letters to Gardner Jackson, one giving an account of the battle with UCAPAWA (9) and the other on plans to organize a chapter of Labor's Non-Partisan League in Arkansas (18). Odis Sweeden voiced the complaints of the Oklahoma STFU against
       Memphis Headquarters in two detailed letters (22 and 23). Finally, there is a mimeographed letter from Mitchell to all locals on preparing for the upcoming primary elections (n.d. [July, 1938])</p>

      <p> The most important document to appear in the papers for August is a 4-page typewritten memorandum laying plans for a Communist take-over of the STFU, which was found by J.R. Butler in Claude Williams' coat-pocket (22). Butler wrote Williams
       immediately, asking him to resign from the NEC (22). Williams replied to Butler's charges directly (25), and Donald G. Kobler, secretary of Commonwealth College, took up Williams' defense in a circular letter (31). The papers include letters commenting
       on the Williams case from Norman Thomas (26), Socialist Party activist Ernest Morgan (29), and Jay Lovestone (31). Butler also wrote E.B. McKinney, detailing the charges against him which the next NEC meeting would consider (27) and McKinney replied to
       Butler's claims (31). Other items of special interest include: David Griffin, STFU Organizer for Arkansas, to WPA Administrator Harry Hopkins, charging that the promise Hopkins made in a Memphis speech of August 5 to hire 200,000 unemployed Southern
       workers on WPA was not being kept (20); a report from organizer F.R. Betton on the situation in Jefferson County, Ark. (13), and Butler to M.W. Jones, a Mississippi planter who asked the union to supply him with cotton pickers (16).</p>

       sent a circular letter to all STFU locals, informing them that the STFU would not receive any representation at the UCAPAWA annual convention because of arrears in dues payments (5). For further information on this matter, see Butler's letters to
       Henderson negotiated an agreement, the substance of which appears in Mitchell's letter to STFU locals (26). There is also a descriptive index of all correspondence between the STFU and UCAPAWA from Jan. 1 to Oct. 20, 1938, prepared to aid Mitchell in

      <p>[Note: Monthly reports from local secretaries are filed in the main chronological series throughout 1939. In all other years, these items will be found in the "Miscellaneous Union Business" section.] On Jan. 1, 1700 sharecroppers evicted from their
       homes encamped on a US highway near Sikeston, Mo. Many of the refugees were STFU members and the demonstration was led by STFU Second Vice-President O.H. Whitfield. . The reader may follow the progress of the demonstration in a flood of telegrams sent
       and received by union headquarters throughout the month, in two STFU press releases (14,23), in reports from F.R. Betton (24) and Kester (27), and in letters from a few of the evicted sharecroppers (24,26). See also copies of letters from Albert Jackson
       (alias "Al Murphy"), a Communist organizer in St. Louis, concerning the demonstration (9, 18), an exchange of telegrams between the STFU and the CIO, requesting the latter to help prevent Jackson from taking over (17), and a 4-page report to the NEC on
       the situation from the STFU field staff in Mo. (21). A 3-page letter from Donald Henderson, requesting that all dues be paid directly to UCAPAWA (28) elicited a stern letter to all STFU locals ordering them to continue to send dues payments to Memphis

      <p>Two issues, the Missouri Highway demonstration and the battle with UCAPAWA over STFU autonomy, continued to dominate the correspondence during February. There are a number of important letters throughout the month by and about O.H. Whitfield, who
       shifted his support from the STFU to UCAPAWA. The papers include reports on the situation in Missouri from organizers F.R. Betton (8, 18) and J.F. Moore (12), as well as a flood of letters from the evicted sharecroppers themselves. One letter from
       Mitchell to Jack Herling gives especially detailed information on the situation (10). The correspondence also concerns the union's efforts to obtain relief for the demonstrators from Northern contributors and the FSA; in this connection, see the
       Financial Statement for the Southeast Missouri Relief Fund, which contains a list of contributors (18), and a letter from R.C. Smith, Regional Director of FSA, on his agency's efforts (27). Papers related to the UCAPAWA fight appear throughout the month
       and include: letters from Donald Henderson to STFU organizers, (23); a four-page mimeographed "Analysis of UCAPAWA" apparently prepared by the STFU (14); a letter from Gardner Jackson, advising Mitchell to comply with Henderson's various requests (21);
       and approximately 30 returns to an STFU questionnaire on the status and condition of all locals (17). </p>

      <p>The STFU withdrew from UCAPAWA on March 12, and virtually all of the papers for March have to do with the split. A chronology of the correspondence and events leading up to the withdrawal is especially helpful (11). Returns from a membership
       referendum on withdrawal appear throughout the month. Advice poured in from friends of the union, including Ward Rodgers (3), Howard Kester (3), Gardner Jackson (13,31), Matthew Woll, Third Vice-President of the AF of L (29), and from two AF of L
       leaders in Texas and California who complained of Communism in the CIO (18, 22). John Brophy, Director of the CIO, attempted to mediate, but his efforts proved of no avail (8 to 11). Three letters from Mitchell are of special interest, one to Butler
       outlining strategy (3), one to Lucy Randolph Mason stating that the STFU had no quarrel with the CIO itself (30), and a five-page letter to The Nation explaining the STFU side of the controversy (30). Donald Henderson held a special convention in St.
       Louis to reorganize the Missouri STFU and Joyce Crawford reported on it at length (13). Odis Sweeden reorganized the Oklahoma STFU into the Oklahoma Tenant Farmers Union; the papers include the Constitution and the program adopted at Sweeden's
       convention (19). The STFU held its own special convention in Memphis on March 19; although the resolutions adopted there do appear (19) there is no record of the Proceedings in the papers. To protect NSW from UCAPAWA, Mitchell and Harriet Young decided
       to set it up as a non-profit corporation; the papers include the legal forms for incorporation (14, 15, 17)</p>

      <p>Donald Henderson held a UCAPAWA convention in Memphis on April 2; the papers include a UCAPAWA handbill and an STFU press release on Mitchell's walk-out from the convention (2). Other items related directly to the feud with Henderson include an
       injunction obtained by the STFU to prevent UCAPAWA from organizing under the STFU's name (5), as well as two long letters from Mitchell to Gardner Jackson and Norman Thomas (3, 10). The Oklahoma STFU was especially weakened by the split; efforts to
       rebuild it can be traced in field reports from W.R. Purcells and Guy Thomas (1,2,30), as well as in Mitchell's report from Okla. of April 21. The Delta Cooperative Farm hosted a Southern Socialist Conference on April 7 to 9; related items include a
       mimeographed report on the conference (7) and a long letter from Norman Thomas to the Conference on building the Socialist Party in the South (5). Two union members were beaten by Sheriff's Deputies at Crawfordsville, Ark., on April 15; there is heavy
       correspondence relating to this outbreak of violence during the remainder of the month, but see especially the affidavits of the victims (24). Correspondence concerning NSW appears throughout the month and includes the Final Financial Statement for 1939
       (28). There are a number of replies from the FSA to STFU complaints (20,21,27), and there is scattered correspondence about the union's search for a new Educational Director</p>

      <p>The work of repairing the union continued during May. Butler prepared an analysis of STFU locals, which unfortunately does not appear in the papers; however, see the covering letters to organizers D.A. Griffin and J.F. Hynds which discuss ways of
       reviving the locals (8), and Mitchell to Blaine Treadway on the same subject (9). Reports on the rebuilding effort in Oklahoma arrived from W.R. Purcells (13) and Guy Thomas (13, 28). Butler tried to persuade Kester declined, citing his many obligations
       (10). The union attempted to pressure Prosecuting Attorney Bruce Ivy to investigate the violence at Crawfordsville, but Ivy proved evasive (13,16,26). Also of special interest are two letters from J.E. Clayton on his plan to purchase the Lowden
       plantation near Gould, Ark. to resettle black sharecroppers (4,6,and June 9) and two long letters from J.C. Thompson, a Louisiana Socialist, commenting on the recent Southern Socialist Conference (15 and June 1). The NEC met on May 13, but no minutes

      <p>An exchange of lengthy letters between J.R. Butler and David Clendenin, Secretary-Treasurer of the WDL, covers the main issues which arose during the month (7,9, 14,26). One of those issues was arranging bail for Louis Johnson, a defendant in the
       "Night-Riding" case which first arose in October, 1938; the papers include a letter from Johnson (17) and a memorandum on the case (n.d. [June, 1939]). Another major issue was a request from the Farm Workers' Allied Union, which had started organizing
       in the San Joaquin Valley in California, for affiliation with the STFU (19, 23, 28); see especially a report on the new union from J.B. Nathan in San Francisco (28). The NEC met on June 28 and decided to arrange mass meetings throughout STFU territory
       in hopes of reviving the union; letters to local secretaries arranging such meetings appear during the last three days of June.</p>

       by the STFU delegation (6). There is also an extensive report from Priscilla Robertson, a friend of the union, on the Poplar Bluff camp in Missouri (5). The STFU initiated a workers' education project during July; one may follow its progress through the
       correspondence of Blaine Treadway, STFU Education Director. Toward the end of the month, there is a letter from the National Federation of Colored Farmers, turning down an STFU offer for affiliation (26), and a letter from Mitchell to former CIO
       official Barney Egan on reorganizing the STFU in Texas (26)</p>

      <p>With Mitchell working full-time for the National Youth Administration in North Carolina, three members of the NEC wrote Butler suggesting that Mitchell resign as STFU Secretary. Butler informed Mitchell about this and other recent developments (9, 12,
       16), but Mitchell refused to resign 914,15). See also F.R. Betton's comments on the dispute (26). A bitter personal controversy arose among the STFU organizers in Oklahoma; one can follow it in the letters of Henry Pippin, Guy Thomas, and W.R. Purcells.
       Also, in relation to Oklahoma, there are no less than seven letters from former state President Odis L. Sweeden asking Butler to rehire him as an organizer. Butler wrote all locals, asking them to fill out a questionnaire form on the desirability of
       holding a wage scale conference; Butler also wrote Mitchell on the same day explaining why he opposed such a conference (14). Other items of special interest include: Blaine Treadway to the Farm Workers' Allied Union on possible affiliation (8); and the
       typescript of a magazine article "Recent Activities of the STFU" by Butler (13)</p>

      <p>Union member in Southeast Missouri were eager to stage a cotton-pickers' strike, but the STFU leadership decided against it. The reader may follow the debate in the heavy correspondence between headquarters and the STFU field staff (13 to 22), and in
       two long letters the STFU field staff (13 to 22), and in two long letters explaining the decision against the strike by Butler (22) and Blaine Treadway (23). The NEC met on Sept. 9; the papers include the "opening Remarks", presumably by Butler (9), and
       the resolutions passed by the Council (10), but the minutes do not appear. Finally, there is a copy of the Constitution of the Farm Workers Allied Union of California (7), and a communication from Frank McCallister on the possibility of arranging a

      <p>Butler, in a mimeographed letter to all union members dated October 26, gave instructions for a campaign to get STFU representatives elected to AAA county committees. When George Mayberry, a black organizer at Mashulaville, Miss., tried to obtain
       information about the elections from Noxubee County officials, he was kidnapped, beaten, and run out of town. The papers concerning the case, which run from Nov. 22 onward, include a letter from Mayberry to the union, asking for help (23), Mayberry's
       affidavit (29), and a long letter from Butler to Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace on the case (25). Another issue developed around Poplar Bluff encampment in Missouri, where several hundred sharecropper families who had participated in the
       highway demonstration the previous winter were living under wretched conditions. Harriet Young warned the union of a Communist attempt to start a relief campaign (9), advice for an STFU counteroffensive came from the WDL (13) and Norman Thomas (20), and
       the union arranged a meeting with FSA Administrator Will Alexander to secure government help (27 to 31). For a report on the overall situation in Missouri, see Butler to Isaac Wells (17). Finally, there are daily reports from F.R. Betton during his
       organizing trip in Mississippi (14 to 17)</p>

      <p>Further items relating to the Poplar Bluff camp include a letter from Butler to Josephine Smoot, detailing the efforts being made for the refugees (11) and an STFU press release on the projected FSA program (20). There are replies from two Department
       of Agriculture officials to union complaints in the Mayberry case, both promising that all AAA county elections will be well-publicized in the future (6, 13). There is an especially important exchange of letters between Mitchell and James E. Sidel,
       Field Director of the National Child Labor Committee, concerning Donald Henderson's attempt to form a "National Council to Aid Agricultural Workers" in competition with NSW (11, 15). Preparations for the Annual Convention and for NSW, including the
       hiring of Pauli Murray as Secretary of NSW, occupy much of the correspondence. There is a draft of a revised STFU Constitution, apparently written by A. James McDonald, who sent Butler a long letter concerning the document (15, 27). Lastly, a four-page
       letter from D. William R. Amberson appears, urging financial austerity and self-sufficiency for the STFU (29)</p>

      <p>The Sixth Annual STFU Convention met at Blytheville, Ark. From Jan 5 to 7; the papers include: the Annual Financial Report for 1939; Revised STFU Constitution; Proceedings; STFU Legislative Program for 1940; and "Resolutions Adopted". NEC minutes
       appear both before and after the Convention (4, 8). Further evictions of share-croppers in Missouri led Governor Lloyd Stark to form a "Southeast Missouri Landowners-Tenants-Sharecroppers Conference". The STFU, through correspondence with the Governor
       and Bishop Billiam Scarlett of St. Louis, successfully sought representation on the committee (3,10,18,20). There is also much correspondence with Missouri locals and with the FSA on the plight of the evicted families, including an outline of the FSA's
       five-point program for meeting the crisis (16). Members of the STFU local at the Dyess Colony in Arkansas complained to the union about the project's management, and the STFU got FSA Administrator Will Alexander to begin an investigation (13, 19, 23,
       25). Complaints also came from the Delta Cooperative Farm; see Kester to Butler about the Trustees' plans to investigate (19). Lastly, there is a report on the status of the educational program by STFU Education Director Evelyn Smith (31)</p>

       organizers W.M. Tanner and D.A. Griffin (12, 13, 20), and through a report from the Missouri State Employment Service based on its own report survey (13). There are several lengthy letters to and from Pauli Murray concerning plans for NSW, as well as
       one from Morris Milgram of the WDL to Butler on raising funds in Hollywood (21). The STFU sent a delegation to Washington from Feb. 29 to March 1 for a variety of purposes; the papers include the delegation's schedule (March 1) and materials relating to
       the delegation's appearance before the Senate Sub-Committee on Agriculture (27, March 1). Gardner Jackson sent out a letter to all sponsors of NSW, asking them to support UCAPAWA instead (24); Mitchell, Walter White, and Benjamin Marsh of The People's
       Lobby all replied immediately (27, 28). Final items of special interest are: a memorandum from Mitchell to the CIO, entitled "An Organizing Committee for Migratory Workers" (10); and To Establish Justice: Sharecroppers Under Planters Law, a booklet by

      <p> A dispute arose between Mitchell and Butler on the question of AF of L affiliation. Mitchell wished to create a new AF of L International, with which the STFU would, in turn, affiliate; Butler wanted direct affiliation. The merits of the two
       proposals were debated in the correspondence throughout the month until the NEC met in special session (31). The NEC also gave considerable attention to the problems at the Delta and Providence Cooperative Farms. Another issue of equal prominence in the
       August correspondence was the case of Robert L. Moore, a Missouri STFU organizer accused of accepting money from politicians, including those backing Senator Harry S. Truman, on the promise of swinging the union vote; see the minutes of Moore's trial
       before the Missouri County Central Council (Sept. 8). Finally, there are copies of statements before the House Committee on Interstate Migration by Mitchell, Brooks Hayes, John D. Rust, and Rupert B. Vance (14)</p>

       that the recent investigation did not deal with the true grievances of union members on the farms (20)</p>

      <p> The AF of L turned down the STFU proposal for affiliation; see the letter from AF of L President William Green, explaining the decision (23). In the wake of this development, the NEC met in special session on October 13; the full minutes reveal the
       confusion and desperation of the STFU leaders. A major topic toward the end of the month was the activities of O.H. Whitfield, the former STFU organizer who was reported to be stirring up racial hatred in Missouri and Texas for the benefit of a UCAPAWA
       organizing drive. On Whitfield, see especially J.E. Clayton's reports from Texas (18,31) and Butler's letters to W.M. Tanner and F.R. Betton on stopping Whitfield in Missouri (25, 29). </p>

      <p>The union's correspondence for January primarily concerns the Seventh Annual STFU Convention held at Little Rock on Jan. 31 to Feb. 2. The convention papers, all filed at Jan. 31, include: the Annual Financial Report for 1940, President's and
       Secretary's Report, Vice-President's report by F.R. Betton, "Put the Man of the Land Back on the Land: A New Policy and Program for the STFU" by H.L. Mitchell, and the Proceedings. The convention was supposed to meet in Memphis, but was shifted to
       Little Rock due to racial tensions, as Butler explained to F.R. Betton (1). Kester's relationship for the STFU became an important issue during the month; see Mitchell's report to Butler on his conversation with Kester (9) and Kester's three-page letter
       to Butler, setting forth his views on the union (28). Finally, a dispute arose between Butler and the NSW policy committee, with Butler claiming that the committee was trying to control the union's affairs (2,10,16)</p>

       did not retract his speech. On the dispute, the papers include a statement by Butler and a statement apparently written by Mitchell (9 -- note: it is not clear whether Mitchell's statement was read at the Feb. 9 or the Jan. 30 NEC meeting), the minutes
       of the NEC meeting which adjudicated the matter (9), and a press release which reported that Mitchell had repudiated his convention speech (10). The rift led Kester to submit his letter of resignation from the STFU (27); see also Butler's reply to
       Kester (March 13). The other major topic in the February correspondence is the matter of arrangements for NSW</p>

       also began a campaign to amend the Agricultural Adjustment Act to ensure a minimum wage for farm labor; see the STFU memorandum on this subject (16) and Mitchell's correspondence with AF of L officials asking for their support (28). Finally, a letter

       report to the NEC (26). Correspondence continued between Mitchell and Harold L. Oram on the matter of selecting a chairman for the projected National Sharecroppers Committee. Sam Franklin wrote from the DCF to express his pique at the STFU's recent

       Hynds (on his work settling claims against the AAA), the "STFU Sign Manual and Ritual", approximately fifty resolutions passed at the convention, including one on the retirement of J.R. Butler as STFU President, and a thoroughly revised union
       Constitution. A set of typed minutes, with handwritten corrections, does appear, but the printed Proceedings does not. For the first time since the mid-1930s, the STFU encountered large-scale violence when a group of planters broke up two union meetings
       at Caruthersville, Mo. on Jan. 16 and 23, and the correspondence from Jan. 17 onward is almost solely devoted to the incident. Major figures involved in the Caruthersville affair include Mitchell, Missouri organizer W.M. Tanner, Governor Forrest C.
       Donnell of Missouri, Frank McCallister, Secretary of the Southern WDL, and William Green, President of the AF of L</p>

      <p>The investigation into the violence at Caruthersville, Mo. continued throughout February and might best be followed through the letters of Frank McCallister, Secretary of the Southern WDL. In this connection, see also Mitchell to McCallister,
       providing good background information on the incident (3) and an exchange between STFU lawyer Claude Cooper and Gov. Donnell of Missouri (12, 27). There is a statement from Mitchell to the Joint Legislative Economy Committee (U.S. Congress) arguing
       against the abolishment of FSA (13) and a long letter from Mitchell to NAACP Secretary Walter White on the case of Edmondson, Ark. (18).</p>

      <p> National Sharecroppers Week was held March 1 to 8; the papers include the NSW pamphlet, a list of sponsors, and an "Outline for Speakers" (1). Negotiations continued with James Patton concerning possible STFU affiliation with the National Farmers'
       Union (7,13,23,25) and the papers include a nine-page transcript of the debate on this question at the March 21 meeting of the NEC (21). Also under discussion during March was a plan to start an STFU Cooperative Marketing and Purchasing Association in
       Alabama; see especially Mitchell to Roy E. Raley, reporting on his conversations with Alabama FSA officials on securing their help for the venture (26). Mitchell to Arthur G. McDowell provides particularly good background information on the

      <p> At the request of Will Alexander, Mitchell undertook a study of the operations of the Farm Bureau Federation in the South. The papers include his letters to Alexander (1,17)) and a lengthy report with attached statements from 98 small farmers
       claiming they were forced to join the Farm Bureau in order to continue receiving their government subsidy payments (17). The Southern Conference for Human Welfare met at Nashville on April 19 to 21; some correspondence relating to the Conference
       appears, but the program and Proceedings do not. There is a press release on the STFU marketing cooperative in Alabama (n.d. [April]), and a letter from Clayton to Congressman Lyndon B. Johnson, asking him to help arrange a $90,000 loan for a group of
       black farmers near Austin, Texas who wish to purchase a plantation (21)</p>

      <p> The union held a Wage Conference in Memphis on Sept. 7 to demand the same wages for cotton picking which the government had guaranteed to Mexican workers imported by the War Manpower Commission. Papers related to the conference include a press
       release (2), circulars, petitions, and handbills distributed at the conference (7), and the draft of a press release which provides a rough account of what took place (9). Toward the end of the month Mitchell went to Washington to try to convince the

      <p> The WMC took up Mitchell's offer and the planning began in earnest. FSA Administrator C.B. Baldwin supplied detailed information on prevailing conditions about wage rates in California, but claimed to know little about Arizona and New Mexico (13).
       Odis Sweeden, a former STFU leader in Oklahoma, happened to be in Arizona and sent Mitchell the missing information (15); the sheet of paper on which Sweeden answered Mitchell's questions is lost, but see Mitchell's transcription of Sweeden's replies
       (20). There are three comprehensive memoranda in which Mitchell set forth his position: one to the War Manpower Advisory Committee, written in response to a request from Walter Reuther (6), one to the WMC itself (15), and one to the Farmers' Union over

      <p> The Ninth Annual Convention was held in Memphis on Nov. 11 and 12, but only a set of resolutions appears in the papers (11). The USES sent information on the conditions of employment in Arizona (4), and, after considerable difficulties, the STFU got
       off a shipment of workers. There are two apparently incomplete lists of the men sent, their age and race (13, 25). On the problems encountered, see Mitchell to Will Alexander (14) and a letter from USES Director John J. Corson (23). The worst trouble
       came on Nov. 24, when 150 STFU workers were stranded at a railroad station at Brinkley, Ark It appears that the state director of USES suddenly vetoed the further transport of workers from Arkansas. On this snafu, see the transcript of a telephone
       conversation between Mitchell and the state director (25; note: this is a fragment of a letter probably written a few days later). The union also received a proposition from the US Sugar Corporation to send 4,000 workers to Florida for cane-cutting.
       Mitchell was wary of the proposal and expressed his misgivings in a letter to Frank McCallister (16) and in a memorandum to Norman Thomas and other friends of the union (18)</p>

       Anderson Johnson. Mitchell wrote the FSA about these complaints (12), but the agency did not reply until January. Beginning on December 11, there is a deluge of letters from job-seekers all over the South in response to an STFU advertisement in the
       Memphis Commercial-Appeal about harvesting work in Florida. On the arrangements for the Florida jobs, see Mitchell's report on his negotiations with government officials (6), his letters to the WMC, informing them that he has 1,000 families ready to go

       Clinton Golden of the WMC Labor-Management Committee, depicted scenes of considerable squalor in the migrant workers' camps (19). Further shipments to Florida were delayed due to lack of housing for white workers; on this and other difficulties, see

      <p>The union's plans for establishing a migratory workers' union came to an abrupt end with the introduction of House Joint Resolution No. 96, also known as the Cannon Bill, which placed the recruitment of agricultural labor under the Agricultural
       Extension Service of the Department of Agriculture. A copy of the bill, which contained explicit anti-union provisions, appears in the papers (11). Mitchell sent letters to a number of prominent labor leaders, asking their help in fighting the bill (15
       to 17). Mitchell went to Washington on Jan. 22 to work against the bill; his report to the GEC summarizes his activities (30). There are copies of three statements by Mitchell presumably made during this trip, one to the House Appropriations Committee,
       one to the Senate to Committee on Agriculture, and a third to the WMC Labor-Management Committee, as well as a statement by F.R. Betton to the Appropriations Committee. All four statements are undated and appear at the end of the month. See also

       even if they left for private employment; see a letter from the Justice Department on this question (July 14) and Mitchell's protest to the WMC (Aug. 28). The union issued a timely bulletin to its members on "Legal Rights of Farm Workers" (June 30, July

      <p> On Sept. 29, Mitchell sent out a letter to several members of the Senate asking them to oppose the continuation of Public Law 45; their replies arrived throughout October. In particular see the replies from Senators Tom Stewart and William Langer,
       who enclosed copies of letters they received on this question from the Agricultural Extension Service and the WMC, respectively (16, 30). FSA official Hayes Beall sent Mitchell the latest gossip around his agency (1, 29). Black STFU organizer J.E.
       Clayton wrote at great length on the Las Cruces colonization project (2,7,12,30). At the end of the month, there is a letter from Mitchell to Leon Schachter, Business Manager of Local 56 of the AMC &amp; BW of NA, on sending 500 to work in canning
       factories in New Jersey (27)</p>

      <p> The Tenth Annual STFU Convention was held at Memphis on November 9 to 11; the papers include a set of resolutions, an address by Charles D. Lewis, Director of the East Central Division of the AAA, and a report by Mitchell. The Proceedings do not
       appear. The most important resolution passed called for STFU representation on the WMC Regional Labor Management Committees; Clinton S. Golden, Vice-Chairman of the WMC, wrote to explain why this was not possible (29). Other correspondence is largely
       devoted to plans for sending 150 workers to the E.J. Hurff Co. in Swedesboro, New Jersey. There is also a good deal of correspondence on the case of Tee Davis, a black union member from Edmondson, Ark., convicted of shooting with intent to kill. For a
       detailed explanation of the case, which concerned the absence of black people on Arkansas juries, see the letter from union attorney K.T. Sutton to Mitchell dated October 12</p>

      <p> A shipment of 150 workers left for New Jersey and reports began coming back to Memphis on how the men liked their new jobs. Problems did arise, as an official of the Hurff Company wrote (23). The STFU quickly set up a grievance committee, which sent
       back a report on its decisions (28). The correspondence about the Tee Davis case continued; see especially one letter from Morris Milgrim of the WDL on what his organization would do to help (20). On P.L. 45 see the mimeographed copy of a lengthy letter
       from National Farmers' Union President James Patton to Senator Kenneth McKeller (18)</p>

       for some criticism by Rev. David S. Burgess, a friend of the union in New York, and Mitchell wrote Burgess explaining the rationale for the "organized migration" (18). Lastly, there is an especially interesting letter from Mitchell to A. Philip Randolph

       opposition of Memphis officials of the War Manpower Commission to the STFU's labor recruitment program (1,3,5) and between Mitchell and the Commission on the opening of four prisoner of war camps in Crittenden County, Ark. (13,26). Mitchell also

       asking for help (1). The reader may follow the progress of the case through the letters of Cotton plant lawyer Ross Mathis (11,13,16,25) and through a "statement of facts" on the case (n.d. [August, 1944]). Rev. David S. Burgess, employed by the
       Congregational Church as a minister to migrant workers, sent two lengthy reports on the condition of the men who did get to Campbell Soup Co. (22,30). There are several replies from labor leaders in California to Mitchell's inquiries concerning jobs in
       the canning industry in their state (21 to 30). Finally, an extremely valuable chart appears at the end of the month; it lists all shipments of STFU workers sent outside the South from Nov., 1943 to August, 1944, with a breakdown by company, number,

       the Commission did not take up his offer, for reasons outlined in a WMC internal memorandum which appears in the papers (12). Two hopeful signs did begin to lift the gloom: Marvin W. Hook of the Meat Cutters Union wrote about sending men for packing
       house jobs in Cleveland, Ohio (10), and the Frank M. Wilson Co. of Stockton, Calif. wrote about employing 100 to 200 workers over the summer (19). Heifers for Relief, an organization founded by the Church of the Brethren, wrote about distributing cows
       to needy Arkansas families (25, 28). Finally, the union filed suit against W. E. Fallas, an Arkansas planter accused of charging usurious interest rates to his tenants; the court brief and a press release are in the papers (20)</p>

       Relief Committee, setting forth a plan to distribute the promised cows through the Arkansas Farmers Co-operative (8). Rev. David Burgess submitted a lengthy report on his work during the month, including an account of a two-day Ministers' Institute held

      <p> As David Burgess reported to Mitchell early in the month, the Farm Security Administration had decided to sell at auction the Delmo Labor Homes Project in Southeast Missouri which had been built five years earlier to house evicted tenant families
       (8). An intensive campaign got underway immediately to save the Delmo homes, a campaign which might best be followed in the correspondence and reports of David Burgess. On this subject, see also Mitchell to Alfred Baker Lewis (19), the Minutes of the
       Tenants' Committee at Delmo (20), and a report on a delegation of Delmo tenants which went to Washington to meet with FSA officials (31). Readers wishing to keep track of the shipments of STFU workers might consult the "Schedule of Seasonal Work
       Orders", which includes information on the dates of employment, pay promised, and number of workers to be sent (20). Finally, the union once again began to recruit black college students for summer jobs at the Deerfield Packing Co. in Bridgeton, NJ; a

       were Senators Frank P. Briggs of Missouri and William Langer of North Dakota, as well as Congressmen Orville Zimmerman of Missouri and Frank Hook of Michigan. The key documents include: a "Fact Sheet" on Delmo by David Burgess (3); the FSA to Zimmerman,

      <p> Much of the day-to-day correspondence during May concerns the recruitment of 300 black college students for summer jobs at the Deerfield Packing Co. in New Jersey; see especially a press release on the project (30) and a "Report on Student Workers",
       which provides a breakdown on the number of students sent by individual colleges (n.d.). Hopes for saving the Delmo Homes were centered on an "Independent Tenants' Committee" of prominent St. Louis citizens which planned to buy the homes and resell them
       to the tenants over an extended period of time; information on this committee can be found in a flood of correspondence on Delmo which appears during the last three days of the month and in a letter from FSA Administrator Frank Hancock to Rev. L.S.
       Thornton of St. Louis (18). STFU Vice-President J.E. Clayton represented the union at the United Nations Peace Conference in San Francisco and sent home reports on his work (1,3,5,12,27,28).</p>

      <p> On July 10, the STFU sent 90 workers to the Frank M. Wilson Co. in Stockton, Calif.; for information on this subject, see the lengthy exchange between Mitchell and the company on the problems which arose (24, 27) and reports from Carrie Dilworth
       (13), Moses Brown (22), and Roy Clay (24), all at Stockton. For summaries of the STFU's current activities, see Mitchell's memoranda to the NSF (7) and to the STFU Executive Council (13). David Burgess and Cong. Frank Hook both testified before the
       House Agriculture Committee on behalf of the Delmo tenants; their statements appear (10) as well as a long letter from Burgess to Mitchell on the same topic (31). Of special interest is a draft of a report by Dr. Arthur F. Raper of the Bureau of
       Agricultural Economics on the effect of increasing mechanization on cotton production in the South 914). Finally, there is a memorandum by Mitchell on the situation at the Campbell Soup Co. where the Food, Tobacco, and Agricultural Workers Union, CIO
       (formerly UCAPAWA) threatened to strike if STFU seasonal workers were employed (26)</p>

       the last week of the month, a furious fight erupted when the STFU learned of Department of Agriculture plans to enact a wage ceiling for cotton picking in the South by holding state-wide referendums. The Department's Arkansas Wage Board held hearings on
       the wage ceiling at Osceola and Forrest City; the papers include minutes of the hearings compiled by Lewis Henderson, a friend of the union from Little Rock (29,30) and a scathing report on the Osceola session by David Burgess entitled "A Preview of
       American Fascism" (29)</p>

       during which the Council voted to ask the government for a wage ceiling (6); Mitchell's statement to the Secretary of Agriculture entitled "A Ceiling on Cotton Pickers' Wages" (10) and his report to the Executive Council on his trip to Washington (18);
       Mitchell to Cong. Frank Hook, explaining the effect of the ceiling on cotton production (21); and a long memorandum from union lawyer K.T. Sutton on the prospects for obtaining an injunction against the Arkansas USDA Wage Board (n.d.). On the continuing

      <p> On October 10, STFU filed a petition for injunction in Federal District Court to restrain the Arkansas USDA Wage Board from setting a wage ceiling of $2.05 per hundred for cotton picking; a copy of the petition and anSTFU press release about it
       appear at that date. Further information on the wage ceiling fight can be found in the correspondence K.T. Sutton and in a letter from F.R. Betton, who claimed that white tenants at Cotton Plant were so infuriated at the ceiling that they planned to
       form anSTFU local (31). Letters and reports concerning the campaign to purchase the Delmo Labor Homes from the FSA appear throughout the month, but become especially heavy during the last few days. The union held a series of pre-convention meetings in
       both Arkansas and Missouri during October; the papers include the minutes of one such meeting held at Dumas, Ark. (13). Finally, reports of trouble arrived from the Frank M. Wilson Co. in Stockton, Calif., where some STFU members had joined FTAW-CIO;

       petition (2). Two other items are of special interest: Mitchell to Clayton, setting forth his general policy on buying land for the purpose of colonizing STFU members (15); and Mitchell to Lewis Henderson on the current strength and activities of the

      <p> The papers become very spotty during both 1946 and 1947, with an average of about ten items appearing each month. During the first few months of 1946, the major topic is the attempt to roll back the USDA wage ceiling for cotton workers. During the
       summer, the STFU, which had changed its name to the National Farm Labor Union (NFLU) became affiliated with the AF of L; the formal NFLU request for affiliation is dated August 14. Also during the summer, the union became embroiled in a furious fight
       with the FTA-CIO over the seasonal employment of NFLU members at the Campbell Soup Co. in Camden, NJ. The CIO union threatened to strike the plant if NFLU workers were hired, and the NFLU retaliated with charges that the FTA-CIO was Communist-led. The
       National Farmers Union also became involved in the conflict, which ended when the company gave in to the CIO demands. On this subject, see the affidavit of George Stith, the NFLU representative at Campbell (Sept. 14). At the end of the year, the union
       started a campaign to stop the illegal entry of Mexican Nationals into Texas, where they were used to depress the wage standards of American farm labor; see especially the detailed letter from a U.S. Customs Patrol inspector at Alpine, Texas to Mitchell
       on why his service was unable to stop the "wetback" immigration (Dec. 9)</p>

      <p> Black workers at the Edgar F. Hurff Co. in New Jersey loyal to FTA-CIO staged a wildcat strike during April demanding that the company sever its agreement with the AFL Meat Cutters Union. Since the NFLU placed its own workers at the Hurff Co. through
       the Meat Cutters, the union became directly involved in the dispute. See the detailed reports of F.R. Betton, who was sent to New Jersey to help quash the strike. The NFLU's own strike at the Di Giorgio Corp. continued and may be followed through the
       strike bulletins (3, 18). There is some correspondence with the Hollywood AFL Film Council about a film produced by the Council on the Di Giorgio strike (15, 22). In April and continuing until October, there is a sizable volume of correspondence to and
       from I. Lee Parker, NFLU Labor Placement Director, about seasonal jobs outside the South. Finally, in the undated section at the end of the month, there is a lengthy "Organizational Repot on California Farm Labor" by Hank Hasiwar</p>

       injunction against the NFLU's nationwide picketing scheme, terming it a "secondary boycott"; information on the injunction may be found in two long letters from Ernesto Galarza (23, 27) and in an NFLU press release (28). The union issued a statement on
       the importation of foreign nationals to depress American farm wages (4), and Mitchell complained to USES Director Robert C. Goodwin on the use of West Indian workers in the Florida sugar cane industry (15). There is a report on the status of the college

      <p> The progress of the seasonal labor program may be followed in the letters from I. Lee Parker to Mitchell (3,7,11,18) and in the correspondence from the J.H. Heinz Co., which employed 80 NFLU workers at its plants in Muscatine, Iowa and Bowling Green,
       Ohio. The NFLU statement to the NLRB on the Di Giorgio injunction suit appears on August 3; see also the report from Hank Hasiwar on the court proceedings (18). A USIS Border Patrol guard at El Paso, Texas wrote Mitchell about the numerous violations of
       the immigration law at his station (1). There is a three-page mimeographed letter sent out by the Southeast Louisiana Dairy Farmers Union to its members explaining its decision to switch affiliation from the Teamsters Union to the NFLU (5), and a letter
       from Mitchell to AFL President William Green, asking for assistance in hiring two new organizers to work with the Louisiana dairy farmers and with citrus laborers in Florida (16)</p>

      <p> From May 23 to June 25, the NFLU led a strike of 6,000 fruit and vegetable workers in the Imperial Valley in an effort to win collective bargaining and an end to the exploitation of "wetback" labor. A voluminous number of letters, telegrams, and

       a legal complaint filed by the NFLU against the Department of Labor to force the Department to remove all Mexican Nationals from the strike area (May 31); a seven-page confidential memorandum by Hank Hasiwar on the "Operation of s of the NFLU in the

       Materials of the President's Commission on Migratory Labor. Materials on this subject include information on the NFLU preparations for the hearings (Jan. 8 to 13), and statements by Louisiana strawberry farmer Lester Felder, California migrant workers
       Juanita Garcia and Hughe C. Williams, NFLU Vice-President F. R. Betton, Rev. Arthur C. Churchill, and organizer George Stith (Feb. 14). There is a letter from organizer Bill Becker on the latest developments in the dispute with the Schenley Co. (Jan 2),
       and a union press release on a wildcat strike by Schenley grape pickers at Delano, California (Jan. 10). The papers include a report by Galarza on "The Present Situation in the Imperial Valley" (Feb. 1), and a number of detailed letters from Hank
       Hasiwar, who had moved to Louisiana to organize strawberry farmers and began his stay with a highly successful two-day strike (Jan. 7; Feb 22, 25)</p>

      <p> The Schenley Ranch at Delano, California laid off 100 workers, all NFLU members, and the union, claiming it was a lock-out, asked various AF of L Central Labor Councils to put Schenley products on the "unfair" list. The Schenley dispute may best be
       followed through the correspondence to and from Bill Becker, the NFLU organizer at Delano. There are three union press releases on the dispute (March 20, 25, 29). The papers include two detailed press releases, one from the Department of Labor and one
       from the union, on a meeting of the USES Federal Advisory Council which recommended that the Department conduct on-the-spot hearings on the availability of domestic labor before permitting the certification of foreign contract nationals (April 3,4)</p>

       determine if the union's co-operative marketing scheme for strawberries violated the anti-trust laws (22, 28). Toward the end of the month, tension began to build once again in the Imperial Valley of California; see the correspondence from Galarza

      <p> [Note: the union changed its name to the National Agricultural Workers Union (NAWU) as of June.] Due to an NAWU strike threat, the Department of Labor began a crackdown on the use of "wetbacks" and "braceros" in the Imperial Valley. The letters of a
       joyous Ernesto Galarza provide details on the union's victory, as does an NAWU press release (June 15). The union won a partial victory in the dispute with Schenley; Bill Becker reported the details of the agreement in a June 5 letter to AFL Central
       Unions. The NAWU strawberry growers in Louisiana staged some kind of strike action during June, but there is almost nothing about it in the papers except for a July 1 letter from organizer Hank Hasiwar. There is an interesting exchange between Mitchell
       and Hasiwar during August on plans to organize Louisiana sugar cane workers (9,19,20). The union also called a successful strike of melon-pickers at Los Banos, California which resulted in the deportation of 300 wetbacks; see the letters from Galarza
       (Aug. 25 and n.d. [August]) and a press release (Aug. 23). Finally, there is a list of workers sent by the NAWU Mid-South office to the H.J. Heinz Co. in Salem, NJ for seasonal work (Aug. 3)</p>

      <p> The October meeting of the National Executive Board decided on several drastic changes in the union's operations, among them the closing down of the NAWU office in Fresno, California and the firing of Fresno organizer William Swearingen, who had
       allegedly permitted Communists to join his local. The papers for November and December are full of long, philosophical letters between Mitchell and his key organizers (Galarza, Hasiwar, and Becker) on the shake-up and on the NAWU's future strategy.
       There is also a set of notes by Galarza setting forth the pros and cons of the Department of Labor's plan to fix the prevailing wages of braceros (Nov. 19) and his five-page statement on the practice of deducting the cost of tie-wires (Twistems) from
       the wages of carrot tiers (Dec. 5). Finally, the union filed claims with the Department of Agriculture for the unpaid wages of 392 Louisiana sugar cane workers; see two letters from Hank Hasiwar to the Department (Nov. 3,6) and a NAWU press release on
       this subject (Dec 17). The Department's reply appears on April 10, 1953</p>

       to prevent the deportation of those contract Nationals who had joined the NAWU. On this subject, see the correspondence with Galarza and with San Francisco lawyer James A. Murray. In Louisiana, the NAWU Fruit and Vegetable Producers Union faced possible
       anti-trust prosecution based on its co-operative arrangement for marketing strawberries; the papers include a letter from Mitchell to La. organizer Hank Hasiwar on legal strategy (May 19), a seven-page letter from Mitchell to Stanley Barnes, Chief of

       of protest to George Meany, charging that UPWA activities in California and Louisiana were in violation of the AFL-CIO No-Raiding Agreement (June 1, 10). There is no written reply from Meany, but see Mitchell's letter to Galarza recounting his telephone
       conversation with Meany on this problem and on the future of the NAWU (June 4). The papers also include an exchange between NAWU lawyers Joseph Rauh, Jr. and Paul Barker on further problems with the Louisiana Fruit and Vegetable Producers Union (May 17,
       19)</p>

      <p> The NAWU and the UPWA met twice during the summer to attempt to set up a Joint Organizing Committee of Agricultural and Packinghouse Workers; see the memorandum on the July meeting (July 2), a letter from Mitchell to Meany on the August meeting (Aug.
       3), and the drafts of proposals for the joint organizing effort (Aug. 4, 15). There is an interesting exchange between Mitchell and New Orleans lawyer Aubrey B. Hirsch on the Right-to-Work Bill recently passed by the Louisiana legislature and on the
       prospects for organizing sugar cane workers in general (July 9, 14, 16). See also the 159-page report by Galarza on "Louisiana Sugar Cane Workers" (n.d. [August). From August 6 to September 16, Mitchell was in Europe; the papers include his speech on
       "The Organization of Farm Workers USA" delivered before the International Landworkers Federation Congress in Stockholm (Aug. 17), and his "Report on Agricultural Labor Conditions in the Netherlands" (Sept 10)</p>

      <p> Negotiations continued with AFL and CIO officials on arranging a joint organizing drive for agricultural workers and on stopping the encroachments of the UPWA on NAWU territory. For a running account of the dispute with UPWA, see the correspondence
       between Mitchell and Galarza during October and November and the exchange between Mitchell and Meat Cutter's Secretary-Treasurer Patrick Gorman (Oc.t 8, 19). The CIO called a strike at the South Coast Sugar Corporation Sugar Refinery at Mathews,
       Louisiana, and Galarza went to Mathews to help out; see his lengthy memorandum and letter to Victor Reuther complaining about the CIO handling of the strike (Nov. 16, Dec 8). On the Louisiana sugar situation, there is also a memorandum by Mitchell on
       "An Organizing Program in South Louisiana" (Dec. 16) and an exchange with New Orleans Lawyer C. Paul Barker on Galarza's plan to set up an independent union for sugar workers supported by the Catholic Church (Nov. 30; Dec. 2). At the union's request,
       the NLRB conducted elections in a number of Louisiana rice mills; see especially Mitchell to Arthur C. Churchill, enclosing a tally sheet summarizing the election results (Nov. 24)</p>

       (Feb. 18, 21), as well as Mitchell to Galarza on his recent conversation with Victor Reuther, who explained the internal AFL-CIO politics responsible for the grant (March 8). There is a letter from Mitchell to AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer William F.

       placing the local in receivership and by sending organizer George Stith to Louisiana to win the support of the rank-and-file membership. The key documents include Galarza's report on his trip to Louisiana to appraise the situation (Nov 10), Stith's
       reports (Nov 21 to 27), and Mitchell's memorandum on the role of UPWA in the revolt (Nov 14). There is a set of notes by Galarza on a meeting of the Regional Labor Operations Advisory Committee of the US Bureau of Employment Security held in San
       Francisco (Oct 31), a copy of the Proceedings of the NSF Conference on Migratory Labor and Low Income Farmers (Nov 13) and a letter from Mitchell to Walter P. Reuther, stating that the NAWU will not consider a merger with UPWA as Reuther had apparently
       suggested (Nov. 5) ; </p>

      <p> The reader may follow the progress of the attempt to re-organize Sugar Workers Local 1422 through the frequent reports of George Stith (3 to 14). There is a series of letters from Galarza to California Governor Goodwin J. Knight on specific
       violations of the US-Mexican International Agreement in the San Joaquin Valley (3 to 7); see also the reply from H.W. Stewart, Director of the California State Department of Employment (16). At the AFL-CIO Annual Convention in Atlantic City, Frank P.
       Graham called together a group of high-level labor leaders and proceeded to lecture them on the importance of organizing agricultural workers. Dr. Graham's talk inspired A. Philip Randolph, Leon Schachter, and ILGWU Vice-President Charles S. Zimmerman
       to write a memorandum to Walter P. Reuther proposing a survey on the prospects for organizing farm labor (12); see also Mitchell's account of the meeting in his letter to Father Donald McDonnell (17)</p>

      <p> Plans developed rapidly for the survey proposed to Walter Reuther in December; see the memoranda by Mitchell and by the ad hoc committee to Reuther (Jan 6, 18), and Mitchell to Galarza on his conversation with Victor Reuther about the study (Feb 4).
       With the aid of Congressman James Roosevelt, the union attempted to obtain a Congressional investigation of alleged racketeering in the Mexican labor import program; for information on this campaign, see especially Galarza to Mitchell (Jan. 19),
       Mitchell to Nelson Cruikshank (Jan. 28), and an NAWU press release and memorandum on the proposed investigation (Feb. 17). There is a statement by NAWU organizer Raul M. Aguilar, who was refused work by an employer after being referred by the local Farm
       Placement Office (Jan 17), and two memoranda by Galarza on future organizing plans in California (Jan 28, Feb 27). On the continuing dispute with UPWA, see the formal NAWU complaint filed before the AFL-CIO No-Raiding Impartial Umpire (Jan 23), the
       correspondence between Mitchell and organizer George Stith on UPWA activity among Louisiana sugar workers, and Mitchell to Walter P. Reuther on the dispute (Feb 22)</p>

      <p> Due to Congressional pressure, the Department of Labor became more sensitive to NAWU demands to eliminate the abuses of the Labor Import Program. Mitchell met with officials of the Bureau of Employment Security at the beginning of Aril and during a
       somewhat stormy session of Labor's Advisory Committee on Farm Labor at the end of May; the papers include Mitchell's report to Galarza on the first meeting (April 10), a letter from BES Deputy Director E.L. Keenan on the proposals drawn up at the
       meeting (April 14), Galarza's criticism of those proposals (April 16, 19), and a memorandum on what took place at the meeting in May (May 27). See also Mitchell's letter to Congressman John F. Shelley charging that the minutes of the Regional Foreign
       Labor Operations Advisory Committee which Shelley had procured revealed a conspiracy between the BES and the large California growers (April 17). There is an eleven-page report by Galarza on his work during the past year to force the BES to provide jobs
       for domestic workers in California (April 17)</p>

      <p> Mitchell spent the first part of the summer in California inspecting farm labor conditions; for details on what he found, see his highly pessimistic letters to Fay Bennett and Gardner Jackson (July 25, 30). Before he left for the West, Mitchell
       delivered a lengthy statement to the House Agriculture Committee opposing plans to make the Mexican Farm Labor Importation Program permanent (June 11). In the course of his testimony, Mitchell charged that California governor Goodwin J. Knight, then up
       for re-election, was involved in a shady deal involving Mexican farm workers; see Galarza's letters on the impact these charges had in California (June 13, 16) and letters from Gardner Jackson and David A. Munro on their efforts to obtain a signed
       statement on the charges from Mitchell's source of information (July 14, 17, 28). During this summer, the union conducted an "experiment", operating a labor supply program in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Farmers Association; for information on this
       venture, see the correspondence with the Association and with organizer George Stith throughout the summer</p>

      <p> A sudden crisis developed when Mitchell was informed by Walter Reuther that the AFL-CIO was about to revoke the NAWU's charter. As Mitchell and Galarza soon learned, the NAWU was caught in an internal AFL-CIO political battle between Reuther and
       George Meany, which involved the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and the UPWA as well. Fortunately, Mitchell typed up detailed memoranda after each of the crucial meeting held during the crisis; the papers include memoranda on Mitchell's conversations with
       Reuther include memoranda on Mitchell's conversations with Reuther and A. Philip Randolph (Jan 6), with the AMC and UPWA over a possible merger with NAWU (Jan 19), with Victor Reuther (Jan 25), with Walter Reuther again (Feb 25), with George Meany
       (March 3), and with AWOC Director Norman Smith (March 9). Mitchell's 12- page statement to the NAWU National Advisory Council provides an overview of the sequence of events (n.d. [March])</p>

      <p> The union's crisis remained at a standstill until May 6, when George Meany telephoned Mitchell to inform him of the AFL-CIO Executive Council's decision that the NAWU must return its charter; see Mitchell's memorandum on the conversation (May 6).
       Negotiations began almost at once with the Amalgamated Meat Cutters Union to formulate a merger agreement; see Mitchell's detailed memorandum to Leon Schachter on arranging the merger (May 19), his letter to Galarza on the telephone conversation between
       Meany and AMC Secretary-Treasurer Patrick Gorman (May 25), and the resolution on the merger submitted to the NAWU membership in a referendum (May 26). There are numerous reports from Galarza on the situation in California, a set of AWOC bulletins on its
       activities (April 21, 25, 26), and a press release from the Di Giorgio Fruit Corporation announcing a $2 million libel suit against the NAWU, the AWOC, and the UPWA for showing the film "Poverty in the Valley of Plenty" which the NAWU had agreed to
       remove from circulation in 1950 (May 18).</p>

      <p> On August 2, 1960, the NAWU ended its existence as an AFL-CIO International Union and became a department of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters Union. Important items relating to the merger include: a long letter from Mitchell to Harry R. Poole (June 3);
       the minutes and report of the NAWU Executive Board (June 26); a letter from Mitchell to all NAWU locals announcing the final tally of the membership vote on the merger (July 18); Mitchell's memorandum to the AMC on an organizing campaign among
       agricultural and allied workers (July 19); and the final merger agreement (Aug 2). On the continuing dispute with the AWOC and UPWA, see Mitchell's letters to Galarza and Fay Bennett (June 1, 2), the rather bitter exchange between UPWA President Ralph
       Helstein and Mitchell (June 6, 10, 17), the correspondence from AWOC Director Norman Smith (June 2; July 9; Aug 3), and Gorman to Mitchell on his conversation with Meany on securing eventual AMC jurisdiction over the field workers organized by AWOC
       (July 21). There is a copy of "Workers in Our Fields", an illustrated booklet published by the NAWU on its 25th anniversary (n.d. [June])</p>

       Daniel to George Meany replying to Mitchell's charges that AWOC was UPWA-dominated (Dec 9), and Mitchell to Gorman, commenting on the memorandum at length (Dec 29). On Mitchell's growing involvement in the civil rights campaign in the South, the papers
       include his report on a staff meeting on the AFL-CIO Civil Rights Department (Nov 14), a statement by Harry Fleishman, Director of the National Labor Service of the American Jewish Committee on "Equality and the Unions" (Nov 14), and Mitchell to AFL-CIO
       Civil Rights Director Boris Shiskin on discrimination against blacks in Memphis unions (Nov 28). On the plans for a new AMC organizing drive among agricultural workers, see especially the exchange between Mitchell and both AMC President Thomas J. Lloyd

      <p> Mitchell became deeply involved in a civil rights crisis in Fayette and Haywood Counties, Tennessee, where black sharecroppers who had attempted to register for voting had received threats of eviction from their homes. On this subject, see Mitchell's
       detailed memorandum (Jan 17), the minutes of a meeting held at Le Moyne College in Memphis to deal with the problem (Jan 21), and a report by "Operation Freedom" (Feb 2). Legal papers relating to a suit filed against the White Citizens Council in
       Jackson, Mississippi appear in the undated section for January. On the situation in California, the papers include two letters from Gorman to Mitchell (Jan 9, 25) as well as one from Gorman to Norman Smith, protesting against excessive UPWA influence in
       AWOC (Jan 26). There is a long letter from Mitchell to Gorman, proposing that the AMC set up an "organized migration" program to provide southern farm workers with jobs in the North (Jan 19). </p>

       and the letters from leadership toward the campaign (April 13, 19). There is a letter from C.O. Cabe on his work organizing Louisiana dairy plants (April 3), and a letter and set of documents from the American Bakery and Confectionary Workers Union,
       Local 370, on the anti-union tactics of the Huval Baking Co. of Lafayette, Louisiana (April 10). The papers include a letter from Mitchell to NSF Chairman Frank P. Graham requesting a grant for a survey of Louisiana sugar cane workers (March 6), and two

      <p> Local 300 had three different cases before the NLRB during the Spring of this year. The first case involved a Borden Co. dairy plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where the local management began a strong counterattack against the union with the aid of
       the New Orleans law firm of Kullman and Lang; the papers include the transcript of the NLRB representation hearing (April 11), the brief filed by the Borden Co. with the NLRB (April 25), and a set of unfair labor practice charges filed by the union
       against the company (April 26 to May 3). the second case involved the union's dispute with the Sweetlake Land and Oil Co.; see the additional briefs filed by both the company and the union (April 19, 23). The third dispute was with the Louisiana Rice
       Growers, Inc., at Crowley; see the union's Motion to Close Record (May 2), the company's reply (May 11), and the briefs filed by both sides with the NLRB (June 15, 16). Mitchell's weekly reports to Patrick Gorman again provide a running account of the

      <p> For the remainder of the year, Local 300 became mired in litigation before the NLRB. Most of the litigation concerned the unsuccessful attempt to organize the Borden Co. dairy plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana; copies of the various legal papers filed
       by the company, the union, and the NLRB itself appear throughout this three month period. There is also a generous sample of the anti-union flyers which the company sent its employees shortly before the election (Sept 12 to 21). On the other cases
       before the Board, see the NLRB decision in the Sweetlake Land and Oil Co. case, in which the Board held that employees of the firm were not agricultural workers and hence came under NLRB jurisdiction (Aug. 15), and the union's Complaint on the Conduct
       of An Election in the Rice By-Products Co. case (Aug. 31). For an overview of the litigation, see Mitchell's exchange of correspondence with lawyer James Youngdahl (Aug. 29; Sept 3, 6, 10). There is also a four-page report by Mitchell summarizing his
       first year of work in Louisiana (Aug 15). </p>

       charge of unfair labor practices against the company (Nov 23), and the NLRB Intermediate Report on the case (Dec 6). There is a copy of the NLRB decision to hold an election in the Louisiana Rice Growers, Inc. case (Oct 5), as well as the union's
       challenge of the election (Oct 26). In the Sweetlake Land and Oil Co. case, see the complaints of unfair labor practices filed by the union (Nov 1, 26; Dec 18). Local 300 attempted to organize a Lake Charles plant of the Stedman Co., a wholesale fruit
       and vegetable firm; the papers include the briefs filed by both union and company (Oct 26, 30) and the NLRB Decision and Direction of Election in the case (Nov 19). Perhaps most interesting of all was Mitchell's effort to obtain NLRB action against the
       New Orleans law firm of Kullman and Lang, which had represented the Borden Co. in its fight with Local 300. See the Motion to Disqualify Attorney for the Employer which Mitchell filed against Kullman and Lang in the Stedman Co. case (Oct 27), as well as
       his formal charge in an unfair labor practice against the law firm in the Borden case, enclosing a seven-page affidavit on Kullman and Lang's participation in the dispute (Nov 13)</p>

       began a project to convince the government and the NSF to set up a program for training unskilled sugar cane workers in the operation of modern farm equipment; information on this subject appears in Mitchell's correspondence with NSF Executive Secretary
       Fay Bennet, and in Mitchell's exchange with Seymour L. Wolfbein, Director of the Office of Manpower, Automation and Training of the US Department of Labor (Jan 16; Feb 11). The campaign of Local 300 to organize the menhaden fishing industry might best
       be followed in Mitchell's weekly reports to Patrick Gorman</p>

      <p> Local 300 continued to win a sizable number of NLRB elections on menhaden fishing boats; the official tallies of ballots appear in the papers (May 15; June 12, 20, 27). However, the problem soon became one of signing contracts with owners once the
       union acquired the status of certified bargaining agent; see Mitchell's memorandum, giving a chronological account of his negotiations to sign contracts (May 27), as well as several contracts which were finally signed (May 29). There is an interesting
       exchange between lawyer James Youngdahl and Mitchell on the cases currently before the NLRB (April 10, 12) and a letter from Mitchell to various menhaden companies protesting the deductions from workers' pay made to cover the cost of extra crew members
       (June 10). The papers include Mitchell's statement to the public hearings held in Washington by the National Advisory Committee on Farm Labor and a lengthy report on the hearings published by the Committee (May 18). Information on the sugar worker
       training program sponsored by Local 300 appears in Mitchell's letter to NSF Executive Secretary Fay Bennett (April 17) and in a report to Mitchell from Frank Lapeyrolerie (June 3)</p>

       to the Local 300 Executive Board (Sept 13), and his exchanges with James Youngdahl on NLRB cases (July 22, 24; Aug 4, 14, 15). There is a letter from Fay Bennett describing an attack on the NSF by the Mississippi Farm Bureau (Sept 23) and a long letter

       Melvin H. Tyler (Oct. 10) and to lawyer James Youngdahl (Nov 19) and a draft copy of the proposed contract (Nov 23). There is also a memorandum by Mitchell on the status of the contract negotiations (Dec 13). Another important issue was the demand of
       the fishermen for a separate AMC charter, which Mitchell opposed on the grounds that the resulting local would be all black; see his exchange with organizer Willie Berry (Nov 18, 21) and his letter to Patrick Gorman on this subject (Nov 19). The papers
       include an interesting letter from Mitchell to Eugene Cox on the problems of the Southern Rural Training Project (Oct 14) and one to Fay Bennett on the future role of NSF in the South (Dec. 21)</p>

      <p> A dispute arose when the menhaden fisherman organized by Local 300 demanded their own charter from the AMC. The dispute might best be followed through the correspondence between Mitchell and organizer Howard Harrity, in Mitchell's reports to Patrick
       Gorman (Jan 6, 22, Feb 4), and in his memoranda to the AMC on this subject (Feb 16, 24). There is an exchange of correspondence between Mitchell and historian Jerold S. Auerbach concerning Auerbach's interpretation of the early days of the STFU (Jan.
       30; Feb. 2, 12, 116), as well as a letter from former STFU President J.R. Butler on Auerbach's account (Feb 14). The papers include a detailed letter from NSF Executive Secretary Fay Bennett on her organization's activities in the South (Jan 4) and a
       letter from Mitchell to Frank P. Graham complaining about the NSF program (Jan 20). Finally, there is a handwritten report by Mitchell on a Regional Foreign Policy Conference held at Dallas, Texas by the U.S. Department of State</p>

       organizing the working poor in the rural South by building them low-cost housing; see his memorandum on the subject (Jan. 17), his exchange with NSF Executive Secretary Fay Benett (Jan 26, 31; Feb 9), and his letter to A. Philip Randolph (Feb. 9).
       Mitchell also drew up a proposal for a training project for menhaden fishermen (Jan 19). Local 300 continued to experience difficulty in signing contracts with certain menhaden fishing companies; the papers include several affidavits by Mitchell (Jan
       17, 22, 25, 31) and a series of letters from Mitchell to the NLRB General Counsel appealing the Regional Director's refusal to issue unfair labor practice charges against the companies (Feb 25)</p>

      <p> The refusal of several menhaden fishing companies to sign contracts with Local 300 again becomes the most important topic in the papers for these months. Items relating to the dispute include: Mitchell's frequent exchange of correspondence with the
       law firm representing the companies, Kullman and Lang; several affidavits filed by Mitchell with the NLRB on the refusal to bargain; Mitchell's notes on a bargaining session held with Kullman and Lang (Oct 8), and his reports to AMC officials Gorman and
       Poole (Nov 16, Dec 26, 28). There is an interesting exchange between Galarza and Mitchell on the topic of Cesar Chavez (Oct 21; Dec 9). Finally, Mitchell attempted to generate some enthusiasm for convening a southern conference on rural problems; see
       his letter to Jac Wasserman of the NSF staff in Atlanta (Dec 7)</p>

      <p> Mitchell and his associates in the AMC devised a new strategy to put pressure on the menhaden fishing companies to sign union contracts; for details see Mitchell's report on the industry, which includes a breakdown of union organization boat by boat
       (Jan 19), the notes on a meeting of AMC officials in Washington to devise the new strategy (Jan 26), the proposed contracts sent to the companies (Feb. 8; March 14), and Mitchell to Harry R. Poole on the current status of the negotiations (March 8).
       There is a memorandum by Local 300 lawyer John T. Lavey on the status of all menhaden fishing cases before the NLRB (Feb 25). Mitchell attended a special conference on organizing in the white community sponsored by the Institute for Policy Studies; the
       papers include the materials sent him by the Institute (Jan 26; Feb 5,23) and his letter to Sidney Hertzberg describing the conference (Feb 28). Finally, there is a report by Mitchell on the plight of migrant workers in Florida (Jan 14)</p>

      <p> The most interesting topic for these months is the "Louisiana Summer Project", a group of six students and six local residents who made a thorough canvass of the living conditions of sugar plantation field workers in southern Louisiana during June.
       The papers include a proposal and a brief report on the project (n.d. [June]), and several letters from Mitchell to Fay Bennett on the students' progress (June 18, 24, 27), but there is no detailed report. The best summary of the students' findings
       appears in the testimony of Alex Hurder before the USDA sugar wage hearings at Houma, Louisiana; an apparently complete record of the hearings can be found on the microfilm (June 26). There is a copy of the union brief filed in the case of Local 300 v.
       McCulloch (April 21). On the controversy with the AMC over the decision not to organize sugar field workers, see Lapeyrolerie to Gorman, summarizing the campaign to date (April 8) and the exchange between Mitchell and Gorman (April 30; May 8). There is
       a letter from Mitchell to Harry R. Poole which reviews recent developments in the attempt to organize menhaden fishermen (May 20). Finally, there is a great deal of Xeroxed material throughout the Spring, especially heavy during May, relating to the
       firing of Sister Anne Catherine Bizalion as Director of the Headstart Program in Vermillion Parish, Louisiana; see also Mitchell's memorandum on the subject (May 16)</p>

       9), the tally of ballots in the election (Sept 24), and a union press release charging that the company initiated a "reign of terror" to win the election (Sept 26). Three of the young civil rights workers attempting to survey the living conditions of
       sugar workers were arrested for "criminal trespass" at Houma, Louisiana; see Mitchell's press release (July 22) and his letter to Oberlin student Gordon Johnson (Sept 16). On the plans for continuing the summer project, see Mitchell to Fay Bennett (Aug

       operatives in Florida; see also Mitchell to NSF Southern Director Leonard E. Smith on the same subject (Jan 6). A group of students from Oberlin College undertook a winter survey of sugar cane workers during January; however, the only item in the papers
       for these months related to their project is a sample survey form (n.d. [Jan])</p>

      <p> There is a computer print-out of the survey of sugar workers conducted by a contingent of Oberlin students during January which provides a detailed statistical analysis of the workers' living conditions (April 28). A summary of the survey results
       appears in the testimony of Amy Gladstein and Bruce Griffiths before the USDA sugar cane wage hearings at Houma, Louisiana (June 5). The papers also include copies of the testimony by Mitchell, Sister Anne Catherine Bizalion, and Louisiana labor
       official Henry Pelet at the same hearings. Further information on the survey appears in the copies of letters from Amy Gladstein to Sister Anne Catherine (June 10). There is a Decision by the US Court of Appeals in the case of Local 300 v. McCulloch
       (June 19). The papers also include a copy of the Brief of the NLRB General Counsel in the Riviana Foods, Inc. case (April 3), a letter from Mitchell to NSF Executive Secretary Fay Bennett on racial conflict within the Southern Mutual Help Association
       (April 20), and a letter from Mitchell to Frank McCallister on re-organizing NSF (May 22)</p>

      <p> There is a frequent exchange of correspondence during these three months between Mitchell and AMC Secretary-Treasurer Patrick Gorman on the International's participation in a campaign to unionize Louisiana sugar cane workers; see also Gorman's
       memorandum on his conversation with Father Vincent J. O'Connell of Lafayette, Louisiana on the same subject (July 30). The papers include a copy of the Decision of the NLRB Trial Examiner in the Riviana Foods, Inc. case (Aug. 5), as well as the
       Exceptions to the Decision filed by the NLRB General Counsel (Sept 4) and a letter from a Riviana plant employee (n.d. [Aug]). On the Southern Mutual Help Association, see the Outline of Objectives (July 8) and the minutes of the Committee on Farm Labor
       Organization (July 20)</p>

      <p> On the continuing debate over the AMC role in organizing sugar cane workers, see Mitchell's exchanges with Gorman (Oct 2, 23; Nov 2, 10), an important exchange between AMC Vice-President Richard A. Twedell and Gorman (Oct 8, 15), and Mitchell's
       proposal for an organizing strategy (n.d. [Nov]). Several letters from lawyer James Youngdahl provide a running account of the progress of Local 300 v. McCulloch, the suit filed to test the constitutionality of excluding farm workers from the National
       Labor Relations Act (Oct 23, 28; Nov 9; Dec 29). There is a copy of the brief filed on behalf of three civil rights workers arrested during July, 1969 for "criminal trespass" during a meeting with sugar workers (Nov 25). Finally, there is a memorandum
       from Mitchell to Sister Anne Catherine Bizalion on future plans for the Southern Mutual Help Association (Nov 5).</p>
