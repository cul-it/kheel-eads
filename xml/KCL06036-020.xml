   <p>Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities in the
    northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size, political
    influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized labor by mid-century.
    Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and
    living conditions of its members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs,
    health care facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. In
    1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form
    the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE).</p>

   <head id="a4" altrender="biography">BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE </head>
   <p>Isidor Stenzor (spelling variations include Isidore and Steinzor) was born on March 3, 1893 in
    Kassov, Poland, and arrived in the United States in October of 1909. Soon after, he found work
    in a men's clothing factory as an operator, enduring long hours, low wages, and horrible
    conditions. After initially becoming involved in various garment operator unions and locals from
    the United Garment Workers to the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, in 1915, Stenzor joined the
    ILGWU and New York Cloak Operators Local 1. He held numerous union positions in New York,
    including an Executive Board member of Local 1, Chairman of the Cloak and Dress Joint Board, and
    Manager of the Price Adjustment Department of the New York Cloak Joint Board. He then moved to
    Canada to become the Manager of the Montreal Cloak Joint Board from 1939-1943. In 1950, Stenzor
    was appointed the Manager of the Los Angeles Cloak Joint Board, a position he held until his
    retirement. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Stenzor was active in many organizations, including Chairman of the Jewish Labor Committee for
    the Pacific Coast Region and active in the Workmen's Circle and Jewish Socialist Federation.
    Stenzor died on March 27, 1988 at the age of 95.</p>

   <head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
   <p>The collection of Isidor Stenzor covers the years between 1920 through the 1970s providing
    information on both his professional activity for the ILGWU as well as his personal activities
    and engagements. A large portion of the collection is in Yiddish. There is general union
    correspondence, reports and statements for various committees and Joint Boards of which Stenzor
    was involved. Also included are clippings, articles and statements regarding the centralization
    of control in the garment industry. The Uniform Industrial Control Plan aimed at allowing one
    business agent to gain control over a manufacturer as well as the inside shop and contractors.
    According to the plan and the included report, the business agent would have complete
    supervision by holding meetings, listening to complaints, and settling prices. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Additionally, a significant amount of the collection contains material collected during
    Stenzor's time as a communist. From the Communist Party and Communist Party of the USA, there
    are mailings, letters, statements, information from meetings, doctrines, bulletins, and
    expulsion of members. Much of the correspondence involves Jay Lovestone and Charles Zimmerman.
    There are requests for Stenzor to appear before the party in regards to the merger of the
    Cloakmakers Progressive League with the Trade Union Center and other involvements with
    Cloakmakers Local 1. Also included is material from the Council of Needle Trades Progressive
    Groups and the Independent Labor League of America (a Constitution and a Discussion Bulletin).
    The collection contains material regarding anti-war activities, including information,
    correspondence, flyers and meeting minutes for the group "Keep America Out of War," in which
    Stenzor was a member of the New York Council before resigning.</p>
