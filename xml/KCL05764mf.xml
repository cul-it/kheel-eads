            <head id="a5" altrender="organizational history">ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY </head>
            <p>The American Bureau of Industrial Research (ABIR) was established in 1904 at the
                University of Wisconsin at Madison to collect primary historical materials on the
                American labor movement. </p>
            <p>John Samuel was appointed a Knights of Labor organizer in 1881, and three years later
                became a member of the Knight's Co-operative Board. By the early 1890's Samuel's
                formal connection with the Knights lapsed but his interest in cooperation continued.
                He became general secretary of the Co-Operative Union of the United States and
                Canada in 1894. </p>
            <p>In 1883, Joseph P. McDonnell was instrumental in organizing the New Jersey Federation
                of Trades and Labor Unions, on which he served as chairman for many years. He was
                also president of the American Federation of Labor in New Jersey. In 1892 McDonnell
                was appointed to the New Jersey Board of Arbitration, and later served as president
                of the Board. </p>
            <p>Albert R. Parsons, an anarchist and militant labor advocate, was one of four men
                executed following the 1886 Haymarket bombing in Chicago. </p>
            <p>Edward H. Rogers was a largely self-educated labor reformer, politician, and
                theologian. He helped found the Christian Labor Party in 1872. </p>
            <p>Ira Steward rose to leadership in the Machinist's and Blacksmiths' International
                Union during the Civil War and later became one of the most astute writers on
                American labor issues. In 1877 he helped to form the International Labor Union. </p>
            <p>Thomas Phillips was instrumental in founding the Union Co-operative Association and
                by 1869, he had become active in the Knights of St. Crispin. In the 1870's he served
                as an organizer in the Sovereigns of Industry and later in the Knights of Labor. In
                1889 he was elected national president of the Boot and Shoe Workers International
                Union. </p>
            <p>The Noble Order of the Knights of Labor was first organized in the Philadelphia
                garment industry in 1869. It constituted the most powerful force in American labor
                in the nineteenth century. It was the first national labor organization to
                extensively recruit women and blacks, to organize throughout the country, and to
                attempt to unify industrial and agrarian workers. </p>
            <p>The Sovereigns of Industry was a cooperative and fraternal order. Beginning as the
                Patrons of Industry, the organization was renamed as the Sovereigns in 1874.</p>

            <head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
            <p>Nearly all the Samuel papers concern cooperation in this country and in England, the
                Knights of Labor, and related topics. The collection consists of correspondence,
                notebooks and publications. </p>
            <p>The bulk of the McDonnell papers consist of annual reports of the New Jersey
                Federation of Trades and Labor Unions and a manuscript report of the New Jersey
                Board of Arbitration for 1893-1894. </p>
            <p>Nearly all of the Parsons papers document the trial for the murder of a policeman who
                died in the 1886 Haymarket bombing in Chicago. Included are correspondence, notes
                taken by Parsons during the trial, and a large volume of clippings and broadsides. </p>
            <p>The Rogers papers cover reform issues in education, labor, and religion and comprise
                four series: correspondence, autobiography, notebooks and pamphlets, and
                miscellaneous articles. </p>
            <p>The Steward papers center on the eight-hour movement and are divided in to four major
                series: typescripts of writings, manuscript bundles of writings, letters and
                Philadelphia Central Eight Hour League. </p>
            <p>The Phillips papers, including correspondence, account books and minutes, cover the
                principles and propects of cooperation and the workings of cooperative societies. </p>
            <p>The Knights of Labor papers contain three series: bound volumes, papers, and
                yearbooks. Topics include negotiation and arbitration with executives of companies
                and internal union affairs. </p>
            <p>The Sovereigns of Industry collection consists of six series: papers, bound volumes,
                correspondence, records of members, printed material and records. These include
                statistics on membership, financial records, etc. </p>
            <p>The documents in the Geisse and Huebner collection consist entirely of questionnaires
                and correspondence in answer to the question "Does the development of trade unionism
                in the U.S. during the last twenty years show the general tendency of that
                development to be in the aggregate, contrary to the best interests of the
                country?"</p>
