            <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
                unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
                about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
                first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played a
                key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally
                referred to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope,
                membership size, and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces
                in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's
                garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its
                members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care
                facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The
                ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form
                the Union of Needle trades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged
                with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a
                new union known as UNITE HERE. The two unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented
                only 250,000 workers between them, down from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000
                in 1969.</p>

            <head id="a5" altrender="organizational history">ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY </head>
            <p>Beginning in March 1924, the ILGWU and the Joint Board of Cloak and Dressmakers'
                Union began negotiations with the Merchants' Ladies' Garment Association (jobbers),
                the Cloak, Suit and Skirt Manufacturers' Protective Association (manufacturers), and
                the American Cloak and Suit Manufacturers' Association (sub-manufacturers). When no
                agreement could be reached by June 1924, New York Governor Alfred E. Smith appointed
                a Special Advisory Commission consisting of George Gordon Battle (Chairman), Herbert
                Lehman, Arthur Wolf, Lindsay Rogers, and Bernard Schientag (State Industrial
                Commissioner). Representing the union and associations were Morris Hillquit (ILGWU),
                Samuel Blumberg (Merchants' Ladies' Garment Association) and William Klein (Cloak
                and Suit Manufacturers' Protective Association). Public hearings took place between
                June 17 and June 25, and on June 27, recommendations were submitted. Accepted by the
                union, sub-manufacturers, and manufacturers, the jobbers refused until July 7, 1924
                when the Merchants' Association agreed to the terms of the Governors'
                Commission.</p>

            <head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
            <p>The collection contains the typed transcripts from the hearings of the Special
                Commission appointed by Governor Smith to investigate and arbitrate the existing
                differences between the ILGWU and the associations of manufacturers and jobbers.
                Taking place at the office of the State Labor Department in New York City, the
                records contain hearings that date between July 15, 1924 and October 27, 1924. In
                the form of questions and answers between the Special Commission and the
                representatives of the ILGWU and manufacturers' associations, discussion focuses on
                the role of designers within manufacturing, conditions in the industry, the
                responsibility of jobbers and sub-manufacturers, and salary and wages. </p>

                Commission on June 17, 1924 to study the situation in the Cloak and Suit Industry
                and be able to offer recommendations to avert any impending strike. The hearings are
                in bound volumes and include June 17-19, 1924; June 20-23, 1924; June 24-July 11,
                1924; July 15-August 1, 1924; August 12-October 2, 1924; and January 2-April 15,
