            <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
                unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
                about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
                first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played a
                key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally
                referred to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope,
                membership size, and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces
                in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's
                garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its
                members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care
                facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The
                ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form
                the Union of Needle trades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged
                with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a
                new union known as UNITE HERE. The two unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented
                only 250,000 workers between them, down from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000
                in 1969.</p>

            <p>Fabio Schettini was born in Brooklyn, New York on September 26, 1909. He earned his
                Bachelor of Science fron City College in 1943. Mr. Schettini joined ILGWU Local 48
                in May 1944, where his mother-in-law was already a member. He worked as a business
                agent, price adjuster, and union organizer for the ILGWU. Mr. Schettini participated
                in the Mirror Coat Strike in 1949 and organized for the ILGWU in Bensonhurst
                neighborhood in Brooklyn. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>According to his ILGWU autobiography (see Collection 5087/177, Box 2, Folder 30), he
                "learned [his] trade in Italy for four years and had [his] entire education in the
                evening schools of New York City. [He] was for 16 years a member of the Amalgamated
                Clothing Workers of America." </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>In 1964, he ran for New York State Assembly as the Liberal Party candidate, loosing
                to Democrat Noah Goldstein. In 1965, he ran for New York City Council as a Liberal
                Party candidate and campaigned for Republican John Lindsay's mayoral campaign. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Mr. Schettini was married to Antoinette Schettini. Together they had five children:
                Roland, Elaine, Linda, Nicholas, and Terry. His widow and children donated the
                materials in this collection.</p>

            <p>Local 48 of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), also known as
                the Italian Cloakmakers' Union, was chartered by members of Local 1 and Local 35 in
                1916 and based in New York, New York. As membership and industry declined in the
                1970s, the local became Local 48 United Coat, Suit and Allied Garment Workers' Union
                of Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island (coat and suit workers in all crafts in
                Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island), and later Local 48 Coat, Suit, Dress, Rainwear
                and Allied Workers Union of North Brooklyn. In late 1981, the Joint Board approved a
                measure to dissolve Local 48, and Local 89 was renamed Local 89-48 to honor the
                historic significance of the Italian cloakmakers.</p>
