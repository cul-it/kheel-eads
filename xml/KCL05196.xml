			<p>The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen [BRT] was founded in 1883 in Oneonta, N.Y. as a
				protective and insurance organization. It was established to represent members'
				interests in obtaining a satisfactory contract with management. The first Canadian
				lodge was established in Moncton, New Brunswick in 1885, and the first Ladies'
				Auxiliary was organized in Fort Gratiot, Michigan in 1889 by Sophia Granger, wife of
				Henry Granger, treasurer of St. Clair Lodge 241, with the support of the wives,
				sisters, and mothers of the St. Clair Lodge members. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The purpose of the organization was to promote social interaction and mutual aid
				among the spouses of operating railroad workers in this craft. The rail service
				members of the BRT included conductors and their assistants, dining car stewards,
				ticket collectors, train baggagemen, brakemen, and train flagmen. The yard service
				members of the BRT included yardmasters, yard conductors, switchtenders, foremen,
				flagmen, brakemen, switchmen, car tenders, operators, hump riders, and car
				operators. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1969, the BRT merged with three other railroad labor unions to form the United
				Transportation Union [UTU]. The Ladies' Auxiliary was granted its new charter from
				the UTU in 1970.</p>

			<p>This collection contains two bound volumes. One is the Minutes of the Iowa State
				Union Meetings of the Ladies' Auxiliary to the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and
				its successor, the Iowa Joint Board, Ladies' Auxiliary of the United Transportation
				Union. The minutes include such information as where the meetings were held, which
				Locals were represented, the various order of business discussed at the meetings,
				and, in the minutes of the 1969 meeting, discussion about the merger of the BRT into
				the UTU. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The second volume is a King James Bible, referred to in correspondence as the
				"Travelling Bible for State of Kansas, Ladies' Auxiliary to the Brotherhood of
				Railroad Trainmen." This book was given as an award to the Kansas Local that had
				admitted the greatest number of new members from one year's meeting to the next. The
				list of Locals it was awarded to is inscribed on the front flyleaf.</p>
