			<p>The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) was created by Governor Thomas E. Dewey
				on March 20, 1953, removing the control of the city's public transportation from the
				New York City Board of Transportation (NYCBOT) and placing it under the control of
				a public authority. The three subway companies, the Interborough Rapid Transit
				Company (IRT), the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), and the public
				Independent Subway System (IND), which had been unified under direct city control in
				1940 under the NYCBOT were now under the control of the NYCTA, along with the
				surface transportation systems. The governor created this authority, over the
				objections of many New York City politicians, liberals, and labor groups, to address
				the major financial issues faced by the system. The NYCTA signed a 10-year lease
				with the city on June 1, 1953 and took over operations on June 15, 1953, after
				surviving a suit brought by taxpayers and the city itself, alleging that the NYCTA
				was unconstitutional. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Under the NYCTA, the transit system was to be fully supported by the fares paid by
				its riders. As a result, the fare was raised to 15 cents, and a token system was
				introduced. The fare increase, however, was not enough to close the operating
				deficit and the NYCTA began to look at other ways to defray costs, including service
				cuts and elimination of union positions. The president of the Transit Workers Union
				(TWU), Michael J. Quill, threatened a rule-book slow-down unless the NYCTA
				negotiated a new contract with the TWU as well as discussing service cuts with the
				union. Quill asked Mayor Vincent Impelliteri to appoint an arbitration panel; after
				first refusing, the Mayor eventually agreed, and the matter of service cuts was
				resolved. However, new contract provisions were not. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>On December 14, 1953, contract negotiations between the transit employees and the
				Transit Authority came to a halt. Quill warned the NYCTA that when the existing
				contract expired on January 1, 1954, his men would walk off their jobs. Since
				Quill's union represented 34,000 of the 44,000 transit employees, it was obvious
				that his "no contract, no work" policy would mean a complete shut-down of New York
				City's transportation facilities. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In an effort to head off the impending strike, Mayor-Elect Robert F. Wagner Jr.
				proposed that a fact-finding committee be appointed to look into the contract
				dispute. Both sides agreed to meet before the impartial committee while making it
				known that they would not be bound by its recommendations. With the threat of a
				strike momentarily mitigated, Mayor Wagner was able to create a three-member panel
				for the fact-finding committee. The fact-finding committee began a series of
				hearings in January 1954 where the following records were submitted by both the
				NYCTA and the transit employees for consideration. </p>

			<head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
			<p>Inclusive date range: 1953-1954 </p>
			<p>Bulk date: 1954 </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>This collection is comprised of briefs, statements of support, and exhibits submitted
				by the TWU and its supporters to the New York City Transit Fact Finding Board in
				support of their proposed contract provisions; the collection also contains the
				exhibits presented by the NYCTA in support of their position that they could not
				meet the TWU's demands. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In addition to the TWU's proposed contract revisions and supporting exhibits, this
				collection also contains two supplemental briefs from the Civil Service Forum of New
				York, a collection of union exhibits documenting various contracts between public
				and private transportation companies and municipal authorities; of note is the
				arbitration award and agreement between Boston's Metropolitan Transit Authority,
				precursor to the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA), and the Amalgamated
				Association of Street, Electric Railway, and Motor Coach Employees (AFSCME),
				Division 589, which is mentioned in the union exhibits as source material for the
				Fact Finding Board to examine. Another AFSCME Local, Local 380, submitted a paper
				titled, "An American Standard of Living for The Transit Workers of America's Largest
				City." </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The NYCTA's submissions to the Fact Finding Board present in the collection are two
				documents, with exhibits, detailing the financial crises facing the transportation
				system that arose in conjunction with the consolidation of the three independent
				transit lines in New York and the cost of maintain such a large public
				transportation system, as well as detailing comparable rates of pay from other
				transportation systems.</p>
