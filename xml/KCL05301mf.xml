			<p>District 12 encompasses the coal fields of Illinois and, throughout the period covered by these records, was one of the largest and most powerful districts in the United Mine Workers (UMW). District 12 was noted for its violent history of
				labor-management confrontation and, in the 1920's and 1930's, as a hotbed of sentiment against UMW central leadership, notably that of John L. Lewis. </p>
			<p>District 12, in an attempt to maintain its contracts, unilaterally, and against the will of the Lewis leadership, accepted a reduction in the day rates of its members, thus leveling the final blow to the uniform scale of the Central Competitive
				Fields (CCF). In the late 1920's, moreover, District 12 was the center of a movement to unseat Lewis. Led by District 12 President Frank Farrington, John H. Walker, and Alexander Howatt, the movement culminated in 1930 with District 12
				declaring itself autonomous from the UMW. After two years of complicated legal battles, District 12 was forced back into the UMW and Farrington and Walker were unseated by pro-Lewis candidates. In the process, a dual miners' union was formed in
				Illinois, the Progressive Mine Workers of America, which struggled, with questionable success, to wrest the allegiances of Illinois coal miners from the Lewis-dominated UMW.</p>
