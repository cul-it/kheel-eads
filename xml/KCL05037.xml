            <p>An Executive order of the President dated February 24, 1950 resulted in the
                appointment of a board composed of Hon. Roger I. McDonough, justice, Supreme Court
                of Utah, Chairman, Hon. Mart J. O'Malley former justice, Supreme Court of Indiana;
                and Professor Gordon S. Watkins, University of California. Public hearings were held
                in Chicago, Illinois, beginning March 2, 1950, through May 9, 1950 the record
                consisting of 49 volumes of 8,385 pages, and 143 exhibits. </p>
            <p>Upon stipulation of the parties and approval of the President, two extensions of time
                were granted, allowing to June 15, 1950, for rendition of the Board's report to the
                President. </p>
            <p>The emergency precipitating the establishment of this- board resulted from the
                announced intention of the employees represented by the two organizations, to
                withdraw from the service of the railroads represented by the Carriers' Conference
                Committees, in connection with their demands for proposed new rules and changes in
                existing rules governing working conditions affecting primarily conductors,
                trainmen, yard service employees, and certain dining car and other groups of
                employees, altogether about 180,000 employees of the nation's major railroads. </p>
            <p>The issues were numerous and complex, involving such matters as the 40-hour workweek;
                differentials for car retarder operators, footboard yardmasters, and baggage-men
                handling United States mail; graduated rate of pay tables in all classes of service;
                the restoration of the standard wage rates between territories; and modification of
                other rules. Also involved were carriers' proposals to change pay provisions, rules,
                regulations, interpretations, and practices pertaining to the 40-hour workweek (if
                recommended) interdivisional, and intradivisional runs; pooling of cabooses;
                switching limits; and numerous other proposals. </p>
            <p>On June 15, 1950, the board made its report to the President, recommending a 5-day,
                40-hour basic workweek for railroad yard service employees, with an increase in
                basic rates of pay of 18 cents per hour, effective October 1, 1950. Upward
                adjustments in rates of pay for car retarder operators, footboard yardmasters and
                baggagemen handling United States mail were also recommended. The board recommended
                the withdrawal of a number of other proposals of the organizations, including one
                which called for a graduated basis of pay for road conductors and trainmen. The
                board also recommended against the establishment of a 100-mile, 5-hour basic day in
                passenger service to replace the 150-mile, 7 1/2-hour basic day. Among the changes
                in rules proposed by the railroads, the board recommended that the carriers and the
                organizations negotiate revisions in rules to permit interdivisional runs, pooling
                of cabooses, and changes in yard switching limits; redefinition of rules covering
                coupling and uncoupling air hoses; inclusion of a rule covering rate of pay for work
                performed in more than one class of service in a tour of duty, and change in
                reporting for duty rules. It recommended the withdrawal of other carrier proposed
                rules changes. </p>
            <p>During the course of the hearings in this case, two additional disputes on similar
                issues were referred to this same board by the President. (See Emergency Boards Nos.
                83 and 84).</p>
