            <p>The United Mine Workers of America (UMW or UMWA) is a North American labor union best
                known for representing coal miners. Today, the Union also represents health care
                workers, truck drivers, manufacturing workers and public employees in the United
                States and Canada. Although its main focus has always been on workers and their
                rights, the UMW of today also advocates for better roads, schools, and universal
                health care. By 2014, coal mining had largely shifted to open pit mines in Wyoming,
                and there were only 60,000 active coal miners. The UMW was left with 35,000 members,
                of whom 20,000 were coal miners, chiefly in underground mines in Kentucky and West
                Virginia. However it was responsible for pensions and medical benefits for 40,000
                retired miners, and for 50,000 spouses and dependents </p>
            <p>The UMW was founded in Columbus, Ohio, on January 25, 1890, with the merger of two
                old labor groups, the Knights of Labor Trade Assembly No. 135 and the National
                Progressive Miners Union. Adopting the model of the American Federation of Labor
                (AFL), the union was initially established as a three-pronged labor tool: to develop
                mine safety; to improve mine workers' independence from the mine owners and the
                company store; and to provide miners with collective bargaining power. After passage
                of the National Recovery Act in 1933, organizers spread throughout the United States
                to organize all coal miners into labor unions. Under the powerful leadership of John
                L. Lewis, the UMW broke with the American Federation of Labor and set up its own
                federation, the CIO. Its organizers fanned out to organize major industries,
                including automobiles, steel, electrical equipment, rubber, paint and chemical, and
                fought a series of battles with the AFL. The UMW grew to 800,000 members and was an
                element in the New Deal Coalition supporting Democratic President Franklin D.
                Roosevelt. Lewis broke with Roosevelt in 1940 and left the CIO, leaving the UMW
                increasingly isolated in the labor movement. During World War II the UMW was
                involved in a series of major strikes and threatened walkouts that angered public
                opinion and energized pro-business opponents. After the war the UMW concentrated on
                gaining large increases in wages, medical services and retirement benefits for its
                shrinking membership.</p>
