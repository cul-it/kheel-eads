            <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
                unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
                about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
                first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played a
                key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally
                referred to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope,
                membership size, and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces
                in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's
                garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its
                members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care
                facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The
                ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form
                the Union of Needle trades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged
                with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a
                new union known as UNITE HERE. The two unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented
                only 250,000 workers between them, down from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000
                in 1969.</p>

        <bioghist encodinganalog="MARC 545">
            
            <p>The ILGWU Training Institute was established in 1950, under the direction of Arthur
                A. Elder. The Training Institute was a competitive program that offered successful
                applicants one year of intensive training in labor education and leadership.
                Participants attended lectures by ILGWU officers and staff and seminars on topics
                relevant to the work of the union. Graduates of the program, some of whom had been
                working with the ILGWU in some capacity before attending the ILGWU Training
                Institute, were then placed in positions within the union, such as organizer or
                business agent. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>While graduates were placed in these staff positions, one of the ideas behind the
                formation of the training institute was to prepare the next generation of the
                ILGWU's leadership. Indeed, among the first graduates of the training institute was
                Jay Mazur, who would serve as the ILGWU's final president from 1986 to 1995. After
                graduating more than 300 individuals, the ILGWU Training Institute was suspended in
                1961. It was resumed in March 1963, but instead of a year-long program, trainees
                participated in four-week courses.</p>

            <p>This is a restricted collection consisting of evaluations of trainees from the years
                1952, 1959, and 1965. The evaluation forms from the year-long training institutes
                are lengthier and more descriptive. Forms from 1952 and 1959 include name; address;
                personal information; civil status; military record; personal information;
                education; work experience; union experience; parents' background; narrative
                evaluations of the trainee's performance in two field assignments; classroom
                evaluation; and note of the trainee's final assignment. Some evaluations include
                photographs of the trainee. The evaluation forms from the 1965 training institute
                include name, address, personal information, civil and draft status, where, since
                when, and in what position the trainee had worked for the ILGWU, education, work
                experience, and previous union affiliation. </p>
