			<p>Neil P. Speirs was born in Alberta, Canada, on December 25, 1912 and moved to the
				United States with his parents in 1919. He became a naturalized citizen in 1942. Mr.
				Speirs graduated from the University of Idaho in 1934, having majored in business
				and education. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Mr. Speirs began his railroad career with Southern Pacific Railroad, working in the
				railroad's train yards. He was first elected to the local Grievance Committee of
				Adjustment for Switchmen's Union of North America [SUNA], Local 98 (San Fansisco,
				CA) in 1950. In 1952 he was elected as a full- time officer, serving as chairman of
				the General Grievance Committee of Adjustment, Southern Pacific Railroad [SP]. Mr.
				Speirs served in this capacity until 1955, when he was elected to serve as SUNA
				International Vice-President. In 1959 he was elected to be President of SUNA and
				served as President until January 1, 1969. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>On January 1, 1969 SUNA, along with the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen, the
				Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, and the Brotherhood of Railroad
				Trainmen formed the United Transportation Union [UTU]. Upon the merger Mr. Speirs
				became Assistant President of UTU. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1969 President Richard Nixon appointed Mr. Speirs as the Labor Member of the
				Railroad Retirement Board. In 1974 President Gerald Ford re-appointed him to that
				position. He retired from the Railroad Retirement Board in 1977, but served on the
				Arbitration Panel of the National Mediation Board on a part-time basis until
				1978.</p>
