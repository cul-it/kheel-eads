            <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
                unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
                about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
                first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played a
                key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally
                referred to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope,
                membership size, and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces
                in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's
                garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its
                members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care
                facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The
                ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form
                the Union of Needle trades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged
                with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a
                new union known as UNITE HERE. The two unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented
                only 250,000 workers between them, down from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000
                in 1969.</p>

            <head id="a5" altrender="organizational history">ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY </head>
            <p>Beginning in the 1980s, with the decline of the garment industry and union
                membership, the Joint Board of the ILGWU approved a measure to dissolve multiple
                locals to create a stronger financial foundation for the organization. Members were
                transferred to Locals 22, 1-35 and 89. An October 1984 meeting resulted in more
                restructuring of the board and locals into a new Local 89-22-1. Changes in the
                garment industry necessitated the dissolution of the Joint Board and Locals 22 and
                89-48. The charter of Local 1-35 was amended to create the new Local 89-22-1. With
                the consolidation of staff and retirements of managers Samuel Nemaizer, Manuel
                Gonzalez and Frank Longo, Samuel Byer, associate general manager of the New York
                Coat-Dress-Rainwear Joint Board was elected manager of Local 89-22-1. After the
                retirement in 1993 of Samuel Byer, Barbara Laufman was elected manager of Local
                89-22-1. Local 89-22-1 was the successor to some of the oldest locals in the union
                from the coat, dress, suite and rainwear industries, as well as both the New York
                Dress and Cloak Joint Boards. In July 1922, the New York State District merged with
                Local 89- 22-1.</p>
