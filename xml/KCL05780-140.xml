            <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
                unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
                about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
                first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played a
                key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally
                referred to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope,
                membership size, and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces
                in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's
                garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its
                members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care
                facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The
                ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form
                the Union of Needle trades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged
                with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a
                new union known as UNITE HERE. The two unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented
                only 250,000 workers between them, down from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000
                in 1969.</p>
        </bioghist>
        <bioghist encodinganalog="MARC 545">
            
            <p>The ILGWU maintained an extensive library of publications on labor history and
                industrial and labor relations, to support the union's work on behalf of its members
                and the ladies' garment industry. It is unclear whether the ILGWU library
                represented in this collection was managed by the Research Department, which
                maintained extensive holdings, or by another department in the International's
                general office.</p>

            <p>This collection consists of photocopied catalog cards of materials transferred from
                the ILGWU library to the Kheel Center, representing more than 700 volumes. These
                volumes included monographs on the history of the labor movement in the United
                States and elsewhere, government documents on the women's garment manufacturing
                industry, and analyses of federal codes, industry wages, and international labor
                organizations. Also included were publications on the ILGWU, and the union's
                departments and affiliates. The library catalog cards include basic bibliographic
                information. Many of the volumes represented by the cards are now available in the
                Catherwood Library or in publications collections of the ILGWU records.</p>
