			<p>Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr. (July 7, 1868 June 14, 1924) </p>
			<p>Gilbreth was a pioneer of motion study and is perhaps best known as the father and central figure of 'Cheaper by the Dozen'. </p>
			<p>Gilbreth discovered his vocation as a young building contractor, he looked for ways to make bricklaying faster and easier. As time went on he worked with his wife, Lillian Moller Gilbreth, who studied work habits of manufaturing and clerical
				employees in all types of industries. He and Lillian started a management consulting firm, Gilbreth, Inc. </p>
			<p>While serving in the U.S. Army during World War I, he was assigned to find a quicker and more efficient way to assemble and disasseble small arms. According to Claude George (1968), Gilbreth reduced all motions of the hand into some combinations
				of 17 basics motions. Gilbreth named the motions therbligs, "Gilbreth" spelled backwards with the th transposed. He used a motion picture camera that was calibrated in fractions of minutes to time the motions workers made. </p>
			<p>The Gilbreths were, above all, scientist who sought to teach managers that all aspects of the workplace should be constantly questioned. They believed with the use of their therbligs, there was 'one best way' to do almost anything.</p>
