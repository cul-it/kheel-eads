			<p>The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen was founded in 1883 in Oneonta, N.Y. as a
				protective and insurance organization. By the time of its merger with three other
				railroad labor unions to form the United Transportation Union in 1969, it had the
				greatest membership of any of the operating railroad brotherhoods. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen [BRT] was established to represent members'
				interests in obtaining a satisfactory contract with management. The first Canadian
				lodge was established in Moncton, New Brunswick in 1885, and the first Ladies'
				Auxiliary was organized in Fort Gratiot, Mich. in 1889. These records reflect the
				union's political and fraternal activities as well as its actions in the areas of
				collective bargaining, grievances, and railroad and labor legislation. As the
				largest of the unions which merged to form the United Transportation Union in 1969,
				the bulk of its then current files formed the basis for the files now held in the
				merged union's headquarters. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The rail service members of the BRT included conductors and their assistants, dining
				car stewards, ticket collectors, train baggagemen, brakemen, and train flagmen. The
				yard service members of the BRT included yardmasters, yard conductors,
				switchtenders, foremen, flagmen, brakemen, switchmen, car tenders, operators, hump
				riders, and car operators. In 1933, the BRT organized interstate bus operators, and
				included them under BRT contracts held with U.S. bus companies. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>BRT officers were elected at the Grand Lodge Convention of the Brotherhood, held
				every 4 years. The principal officers included a president, an assistant to the
				president, a general secretary-treasurer, Canadian and national legislative
				representatives, a senior vice-president, BRT representative, and National Railroad
				Board of Adjustment representative. The BRT had four governing boards: the Board of
				Directors, Board of Trustees and Insurance, Board of Appeals, and Executive
				Board.</p>

			<p>This collection consists of materials collected by Carl N. Smith, an employee of the
				New York Central Railroad [NYCRR], Grand Central Terminal Division and member of the
				Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen [BRT]. He collected pamphlets from the BRT,
				including the BRT's constitution, agreements between the BRT and NYCRR, the By-Laws
				for Local 598, and general information on the union. He also collected rulebooks and
				timetables from the NYCRR's Grand Central Terminal Division. He also collected
				materials on first aid for railroad workers and on the Railroad Retirement System. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Of particular note is the correspondence file, which documents the various actions
				taken by rank and file members of the BRT in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Specific
				concerns that the rank and file members were concerned with include sanitation
				concerns at Grand central Station, the abandonment of lines, the repeal of the full
				crew consist in New York State and the subsequent loss of jobs, the perceived
				disinterest of the higher ranked union members for the concerns of the rank and
				file, and the state of the Railroad Retirement Fund. This collection also contains a
				pamphlet advocating for a union that served all railroad operating employees, and in
				correspondence Mr. Smith and his fellow rank and file members expressed similar
				desires.</p>
