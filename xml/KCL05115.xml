			<abstract label="Abstract:">An agreement between the parties provided that any issues in dispute would be submitted to a Board of Arbitration. This dispute arose when the parties were unable to agree upon a new wage scale at the wage interim
				reopening on a two year contract running from April 27, 1956 to April 27, 1958. The Board was composed of David L. Cole, Chairman, Edward D. Becker for the publishers and Woodward L. Cannon for the union. Hearings were held in Los Angeles on
				February 3 through February 6, 1958. The issue was: "What adjustments shall be made in salaries set forth in Schedules I-V of Section VIII of the Agreement as modified on November 27, 1957.</abstract>

			<p>David Lawrence Cole was a graduate of Harvard University (BS., 1921) and Fairleigh Dickinson University (LL.B., 1924, LL.D., 1964.) Although he practiced law in Paterson, N.J. from 1926 until his death as senior partner in the law firm of Cole,
				Berman &amp; Belksy, David Cole will chiefly be remembered for a distinguished career as a government arbitrator and mediator. In this field he served on numerous state and federal boards and in various governmental agencies.
				Cole was chairman of the New Jersey State Board of Mediation; a public member of Region 2, United States War Labor Board; and chairman of the Presidential Boards of Inquiry in the bituminous coal industry (1948) and in the longshore industry
				(1953, 1968). Cole was also a member or chairman of numerous Presidential Emergency Boards which settled disputes in the railroad and airline industries (1948-1958); the chairman of the conciliation service for the New York City transit service
				(1961-1965); director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (1952-1953); chairman of the New Jersey Governor's Committee on Public Utility Strike Service (1952-1953); member of the President's Labor-Management Advisory Committee
				(1961-1964); and member of the New York Governor's Public Employee Relations Committee (1966-1968), which established the New York State Public Employee Relations Board. Cole was also appointed as chairman of the President's Commission on
				Industrial Peace in 1973. </p>
			<p>Beyond his public service, Mr. Cole was active as a counsel for employer groups in the textile industry (1926-1942) and as an impartial chairman for other labor-management contract disputes. He was also impartial arbitrator for the AFL-CIO
				Internal Disputes Plan (1954-1976), served as a visiting professor at the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University (1954-1955) and was Kestenbaum lecturer at Harvard in 1962. Mr. Cole was the author of
				INDUSTRIAL PEACE (1963).</p>
