			<p>Mr. William P. Hapgood, president of the Columbia Conserve Company believed that industrial democracy meant "government of the workers, by the workers, for the workers." In 1917 Mr. Hapgood started his plan, by giving the workers the right to
				make rules governing their hours, incomes, hiring and firing and to decide upon all policies of the company. </p>
			<p>Various measures adopted by the plant reflect the improvement of the workers. The 55 hour week was reduced to 50 in 1917 and 45 in 1924 when a five day week and a 9 hour day were reestablished. </p>
			<p>The maximum salary was set at $5,000. per year. Minimum salaries were established were $22 per week for unmarried and $33 per week for married men, with an additional $2 for each child, married women, where husbands were also employed received
				$19 per </p>
			<p>week in 1931. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Dividends were paid to employees at the same rate as on capital stock based on the payroll until 1925 when an agreement was reached for the employees to purchase common stock with their share of the profits.</p>
