  <bioghist encodinganalog="MARC 545">
   <p>Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities in the
    northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size, political
    influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized labor by mid-century.
    Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and
    living conditions of its members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs,
    health care facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. In
    1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form
    the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE).</p>
  </bioghist>
  <bioghist encodinganalog="MARC 545">
   <p>Local union's of the ILGWU established and maintained robust, ambitious educational
    departments early on in the international's history. As these groups grew in size and scope, the
    international office sought to coordinate and centralize educational programming for the union's
    members, culminating in the formation of the Educational Department in 1918. </p>
   <p>The department's programming included courses at the Workers' University at the Washington
    Irving High School in New York City, lectures at Unity Centers and Unity Houses in the
    northeastern United States, and other events. The educational offerings of the International's
    Education Department were varied, as had been the education departments of the local unions, and
    included not only classes in labor studies but also courses in languages, music, and the arts.
    The ILGWU's 1937 musical "Pins and Needles" exemplified the diversity of the union's programs. </p>
   <p>Directors of the Education Department, especially Fannia Cohn and Mark Starr, wrote
    extensively on the ILGWU's programs and worker education in general. Longtime director Gus Tyler
    not only directed the department, but also served as the ILGWU's on-staff scholar. In later
    years, the Education Department went beyond collaborating with other education organizations and
    arranging in-house programs to also supporting post-secondary education for union members and
    their families.</p>

  <scopecontent encodinganalog="MARC 520">
   <p>The Education Department records document activities across the entire period of the
    department's existence, with the bulk of the records covering the 1970s and 1990s. It contains
    papers from directors of the Education Department: Fannia Cohn, Mark Starr, Gus Tyler, and Kitty
    Krupat. </p>
   <p>The earliest documentation of the department's work is found in the Fannia Cohn papers
    (5780/049, 5780/049 P); these contain correspondence, subject files, speeches, photographs, and
    printed material from her work as director of the Educational Department. A microfilm copy of
    the Fannia Cohn papers held at the New York Public Library (5998 mf) complements the Kheel
    Center's holdings. Documentation of the work of another longtime leader of the Education
    Department, Mark Starr, is contained in these records (5780/166, 5780/166 PUBS), as well as in a
    related collection from Starr on worker education programs (5243). </p>
   <p>Documentation of the work of Gus Tyler, who led the merged Education and Political Department
    after Mark Starr's retirement in 1960, is also contained in the ILGWU records (5780/052,
    5780/088, 5780/096). Tyler's papers are complemented by those of Assistant Director Jasper
    Peyton (5780/086) and Special Projects Coordinator Beverly Shulman (5780/106). These collections
    contain routine correspondence and memoranda, reports, materials relating to training
    institutes, seminars, and conferences, and printed material. </p>
   <p>The papers of Kitty Krupat, who was serving as Education Director at the time of the
    ILGWU/ACTWU merger in 1995, constitute the entirety of Education Department records from the
    1990s. They include correspondence, memoranda, reports, and financial records relating to the
    ILGWU's independent and collaborative education projects, including the Worker-Family Education
    Program, the Joint Union-University Committee on Labor Education, and the Consortium for Worker
    Education, as well as numerous trainings, conferences, and seminars. Also included in the files
    are materials from local unions and regional departments of the ILGWU, files on the
    Internationals' conventions, and reports to the General Executive Board.</p>
