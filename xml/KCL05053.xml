                relating to Emergency Board 145 include transcripts of proceedings (15 vol.), final
                report and related documents, carrier and employee briefs, and exhibits. Carrier
                exhibits include documents relating to rates of pay, working conditions, job
                descriptions, and fringe benefits in the railroad industry, especially regarding
                non-operating employees. Also comparative wage data for clericals and workers in
                other industries. Employee exhibits include job descriptions of shop craft, firemen
                and oilers, standards for interindustry wage comparisons and tables of wage trends
                (1949-1958) for non-operating railroad employees and comparable American workers.
                Also documents relating to the financial stability of the railroad industry and
                railroad worker productivity. Additionally, includes a manuscript copy of the final
                report of the Board and newspaper clippings and other papers which document public
                reaction to the decision.</abstract>

            <p>U.S. Emergency Boards No. 130 (1960) and No. 145 (1962) were established to
                investigate and settle disputes involving the Akron and Barberton Belt Railroad and
                other carriers represented by Eastern, Western, and Southeastern Carriers'
                Conference Committees and certain employees represented by eleven cooperating

            <p>Emergency Board No. 130 dealt with a dispute arising out of the vacations with pay,
                wages, and improvements in health and welfare plans. The Board recommended a general
                wage rate increase of five cents per hour, additional carrier contributions to
                dependent benefits and group life insurance, and a seventeen cents per hour,
                cost-of-living adjustment. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Emergency Board No. 145 was created to settle an impasse arising out of "section 6"
                notices served by the parties on each other, proposing changes in existing
                agreements. The organizations proposed a twenty-five cents per hour wage increase
                and six months advance notice of reduction in force. The Carriers' Conference
                Committees countered with a request for a wage reduction and the abolition of
                provisions which required more than 24 hours notice of reduction in force. The Board
                recommended a four cents per hour increase, effective immediately, plus a two and
                one-half per cent increase, effective three months thereafter. It also recommended a
                rule requiring not less than five working days notice of force reduction.</p>
