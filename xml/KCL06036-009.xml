   <p>Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities in the
    northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size, political
    influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized labor by mid-century.
    Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and
    living conditions of its members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs,
    health care facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. In
    1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form
    the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE).</p>

history">GOVERNOR'S ADVISORY COMMISSION ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY </head>
   <p>Beginning in March 1924, the ILGWU and the Joint Board of Cloak and Dressmakers' Union began
    negotiations with the Merchants' Ladies' Garment Association (jobbers), the Cloak, Suit and
    Skirt Manufacturers' Protective Association (manufacturers), and the American Cloak and Suit
    Manufacturers' Association (sub-manufacturers). When no agreement could be reached by June 1924,
    New York Governor Alfred E. Smith appointed a Special Advisory Commission consisting of George
    Gordon Battle (Chairman), Herbert Lehman, Arthur Wolf, Lindsay Rogers, and Bernard Schientag
    (State Industrial Commissioner). Representing the union and associations were Morris Hillquit
    (ILGWU), Samuel Blumberg (Merchants' Ladies' Garment Association) and William Klein (Cloak and
    Suit Manufacturers' Protective Association). Public hearings took place between June 17 and June
    25, and on June 27, recommendations were submitted. Accepted by the union, sub-manufacturers,
    and manufacturers, the jobbers refused until July 7, 1924 when the Merchants' Association agreed
    to the terms of the Governors' Commission.</p>

   <head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
   <p>In an effort to bring about much needed change in the industry, the ILGWU led by President
    Morris Sigman, sought reform in the New York suit and cloak trade. On behalf of the workers, the
    union devised to restructure the industry through the requirement of union shops, sanitary
    conditions, unemployment insurance, regulation of the work week, and guidelines for
    investigating disputes. In March 1924, the ILGWU began negotiations for a new agreement with
    predominantly the Merchant Ladies' Garment Association (jobbers), but also the Cloak, Suit and
    Skirt Manufacturers' Protective Association (manufacturers) and the American Cloak and Suit
    Manufacturers' Association (sub-manufacturers). No agreement had been reached as of June 1924,
    and the union proposed to submit the issues to arbitration. With negotiations stalled, Governor
    Alfred E. Smith appointed a Special Advisory Commission consisting of George Gordon Battle,
    Bernard L. Shientag, Herbert H. Lehman, Arthur D. Wolf, and Lindsay Rogers to hold hearings and
    work out a basis for an agreement. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The collection contains material from the Governor's Advisory Commission during its
    investigation. Included are bound books containing the various and official reports that were
    created during and for the investigation. There are the briefs, the memorandum on behalf of the
    union as well as the Industrial Council, transcripts of the hearings and meetings, supplementary
    recommendations, and the final recommendations on May 20, 1926. Of particular interest is the
    extensive research done in the course of the investigation that provides a comprehensive
    assessment of the garment industry at that time. The reports comprise historical information,
    the current status of the industry, points of contention between the groups involved, the
    demands of reform from the union, many employment and earning statistics, wage and wage scale
    tables and garment output and price charts. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>For supplemental information, see collection 5780/161 Cloak Joint Board Governor's Advisory
    Commission on the Cloak, Suit, and Skirt Industry which contains the first hearing on June 17,
    1924 of the Special Commission to study the situation in the Cloak and Suit Industry and be able
    to offer recommendations to avert any impending strike. The hearings are in bound volumes and
    include June 17-19, 1924; June 20-23, 1924; June 24-July 11, 1924; July 15-August 1, 1924;
    August 12-October 2, 1924; and January 2-April 15, 1925. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The Hearings continue into 1925, and additionally, there is the final Report of the
    Investigation from March 10, 1925. There are also additional reports that were created as the
    result of the investigation including "Wages and Wage Scales, 1925," Final Recommendations from
    May 1926, the Meeting of the Special Mediation Commission in the New York Cloak and Suit
    Industry from March 6, 1926 (same individuals involved). </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Also, additional material can be found in collection 5780/165 Governor Smith's Hearings and
    Arbitration Files which contains the typed transcripts from the hearings of the Special
    Commission appointed by Governor Smith to investigate and arbitrate the existing differences
    between the ILGWU and the associations of manufacturers and jobbers. Taking place at the office
    of the State Labor Department in New York City, the records contain hearings that date between
    July 15, 1924 and October 27, 1924. In the form of questions and answers between the Special
    Commission and the representatives of the ILGWU and manufacturers' associations, discussion
    focuses on the role of designers within manufacturing, conditions in the industry, the
    responsibility of jobbers and sub-manufacturers, and salary and wages.</p>
