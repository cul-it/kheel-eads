			<p>Arlon Everett "Art" Lyon was born in Thedford, Nebraska on October 15, 1899. In 1919,
				after his discharge from the U.S. Army, Mr. Lyon secured a job with the Southern
				Pacific Railroad in Stockton, California as a signal helper. After a few years of
				employment, Mr. Lyon became active in his local union, the Brotherhood of Railroad
				Signalmen [BRS], first as member of the local grievance committee, then as chairman of
				that committee. Within a year, Mr. Lyon became general chairman for the local BRS on
				the Southern Pacific; this was a full time position. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>His rise through the BRS ranks continued, becoming a member of the Grand Executive
				Board of the national union and finally accepting a job at the international
				headquarters of the BRS in Chicago, Illinois. Mr. Lyon worked as the assistant to
				both the union president and the union secretary-treasurer; he also served as the
				editor of The Signalman's Journal, the publication of the BRS. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1934, Mr. Lyon became president of the BRS after being recommended by the outgoing
				union president. Mr. Lyon served as union president from 1934-1945. In 1945, Mr.
				Lyon became the Executive Secretary of the Railway Labor Executives' Board [RLEA].
				He held this position until 1962, serving as the spokesman for all of the member
				organizations of the RLEA in Washington, D.C. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>From 1945 to 1962, while serving as Executive Secretary of the RLEA in Washington,
				Mr. Lyon was assigned the task of representing American railway labor on the
				Executive Committee of the International Transport Workers' Federation [ITWF]. This
				was part of the RLEA's broader responsibilities in the Marshall Plan during the
				post-war period. During this phase of the Marshall Plan, he was one of three labor
				members of the Public Advisory Board of the Economic Cooperation Administration. He
				also served on the Department of Labor's Trade Union Advisory Committee on
				International Labor Affairs. Mr. Lyon was the only labor member of the U.S. National
				Commission for the Pan-American Railway Congress. He was delegate to sessions of the
				Inland Transport Committee of the International Labor Organization. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1962, Mr. Lyon left the RLEA and accepted the appointment as the labor member on
				the Railroad Retirement Board from President John F. Kennedy. He was reappointed to
				the board by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>After his retirement, Mr. Lyon spent his time writing about the history of the BRS,
				American railway labor, and his involvement in both.</p>

			<head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
			<p>Inclusive date range: 1971-1974 </p>
			<p>Bulk dates: 1971-1974 </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>This collection contains a selection of writings by A. E. Lyon, president emeritus of
				the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen and executive secretary of the Railway Labor
				Executives' Association [RLEA]. The topics of the manuscripts contained in this
				collection, and its associated collection 5450 mf, cover a broad range of topics
				about the American railroad labor movement and railroading itself. In this
				collection, the topics covered include an analysis of government relations with
				regard to railroad labor relations from 1920 to 1974; a history of the successful
				campaign to create legislation that would standardize and regulate railway signaling
				devices and systems; an essay about James P. Mitchell, secretary of labor under
				President Eisenhower; and, a memoir that A. E. Lyon refers to as "a series of
				memoirs and historical sketches, a combination of autobiographical material and my
				version of events in the history of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen" (from the
				Preface to vol. 1). </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>These manuscripts provide both historical narratives surrounding major pieces of
				railroad legislation, railroad labor history, and railroad history as well as
				offering the personal insights and opinions of A. E. Lyon, who was at the center of
				American railroad labor organizations for more than half a century.</p>
