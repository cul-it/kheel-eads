			<p>The Wood Worsted Mill is located at South Union St. and Merrimack Street, on the south bank of the Merrimack River, in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The mill building was constructed between 1906 and 1909 for the American Woolen Company, and was
				dubbed by some locals as the "eighth wonder of the world" due to its size. It is a six story brick building that is 1,300 feet (400 m) long and 125 feet (38 m) high, and encompasses some 17 miles (27 km) of aisles. Its purpose when built was to
				perform the complete textile manufacturing cycle of worsted woolens, from raw material to finished fabric, under a single roof.</p>
