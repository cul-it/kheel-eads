			<p>Jacob Potofsky (1892-1979) </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Born on November 23, 1892 (some source cite his birthdate as November 23, 1894) in Ukraine, Jacob Potofsky immigrated to Chicago in 1905. He became a floor boy in a men's clothing factory in 1908 and participated in the 1910 Hart, Schaffner and
				Marx strike. After the strike Potofsky became a shop secretary, served as Treasurer of Local 144 and joined the ACWA at its inception in 1914. He served as Secretary-Treasurer of the ACWA Chicago Joint Board 1914-1916 then moved to New York
				City to assist in establishing a national office. Potofsky served as Secretary Treasurer of the ACWA 1916-1934. He became ACWA Assistant President in 1934 and held this office until 1940, when he became General Secretary Treasurer 1940-1946. He
				was an original member of the Congress of Industrial Organizations' (CIO) Executive Board. Starting in 1940 he served as Chairman of the CIO Committee on Latin-American Affairs, which was later absorbed into the Committee on International
				Affairs. A close colleague of Sidney Hillman, Potofsky became President of the ACWA after Hillman's death in 1946 and held the post until 1972. He raised funds for organizations dedicated to the war effort such as the Red Cross, and the New
				York National War Fund. After the merger of the AFL and the CIO he served at vice-president and executive council member of the AFL-CIO. He was also a member of a large number of boards for public and private agencies and served as President of
				the Amalgamated Insurance Co., Chairman of the Amalgamated Insurance Fund, Chairman of Boards and President of Amalgamated Savings Bank of NY, and Director Amalgamated Trust &amp; Savings Bank, Chicago. </p>

			<p>Mr. Potofsky died on August 5, 1979, in New York City.</p>
