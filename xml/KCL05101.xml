            <p>Pursuant to Section 141 of the State Labor Law of the State of New York, a State
                Board of Mediation and Arbitration was appointed to investigate the lockout of
                employees of the two Syracuse Plants of the Crucible Steel Company. Hearings were
                begun on June 17, 1913 before a Board composed of the following men: William C.
                Rogers, Chairman; P.J. Downey; and James McManus. </p>
            <p>About the first of April, 1913 approximately 1,000 of the 1,500 employees of the two
                Syracuse plants joined together to discuss the formation of a union. On May 10, 1913
                a notice was posted by the employer in all of the departments stating that the two
                Syracuse plants would be closed indefinitely. The notice further stated that any
                employee who wished to remain at work could do so by signing a statement that he was
                not a member of the union. The obvious intent of the company was to break the union
                through a lockout of union members. At the time of the hearings, over 900 men were
                still out of work. </p>
            <p>The union was formed to improve the wages and working conditions of all employees at
                the two plants. For the most part, wages had not risen for 20 years. The physical
                working conditions were bad, and the men often had to pay for their tools, and
                equipment under the sub-contracting system which existed in some parts of the
                plants. The employees wanted to establish a departmental shop committee system,
                which would allow them to present their grievances and demands as a group, rather
                than as individuals. The employees did not ask for company recognition of the union,
                they asked only for recognition of the shop committee. </p>
            <p> The company refused, as a matter of policy, to allow its employees to organize a
                union. The company stated that it would not consider dealing with shop committees
                unless the employees returned to the plants as non-union employees. Upon
                satisfaction of that condition, the company stated, the question of shop committees
                would be considered.</p>
