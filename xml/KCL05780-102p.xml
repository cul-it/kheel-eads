   <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor unions in
    the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in
    cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the first U.S. Unions to have a
    membership consisting of mostly females, and it played a key role in the labor history of the
    1920s and 1930s. The union is generally referred to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew
    in geographical scope, membership size, and political influence to become one of the most
    powerful forces in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's
    garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its members
    through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care facilities, cooperative
    housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated
    Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form the Union of Needle trades, Industrial and
    Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union
    (HERE) in 2004 to create a new union known as UNITE HERE. The two unions that formed UNITE in
    1995 represented only 250,000 workers between them, down from the ILGWU's peak membership of
    450,000 in 1969.</p>

   <p>Justice was the official weekly publication of the ILGWU from 1919 to 1995. The union employed
    photographers to record events and activities for use in the publication. This collection
    contains photographs used in, or considered for use in, Justice. The photographs document a wide
    range of ILGWU activities and institutions, as well as many ILGWU members, staff, and officers.
    They are arranged by subject, such as an individual, Local number, Region or Department name,
    event (convention, parade) or topic (shop scenes, imports).</p>
