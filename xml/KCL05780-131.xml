            <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
                unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
                about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
                first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played a
                key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally
                referred to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope,
                membership size, and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces
                in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's
                garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its
                members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care
                facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The
                ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form
                the Union of Needle trades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged
                with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a
                new union known as UNITE HERE. The two unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented
                only 250,000 workers between them, down from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000
                in 1969.</p>

            <p>The Cutters of Local 10 can be traced back to the Gotham Knife Cutters of 1884 and
                the United Cloak Cutters in 1886 by the Knights of Labor. These were the
                predecessors of Local 15 and 6 which were chartered by the ILGWU in 1902 and merged
                to become Local 10 in 1906. Local 10 played a lead role in the 1910 cloakmakers'
                strike. Local 10 of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), was
                also known as the Amalgamated Ladies' Garment Cutters' Union, and based in New York
                City.</p>

            <p>The collection contains records documenting the election of officers to Local 10.
                Harry Shaw was a candidate for the office of Secretary of the Executive Board in
                1971. Shaw alleged 18 instances of impropriety in connection with Local 10 elections
                of February 1971. Included are files relating to Shaw's protest and appeals to Local
                10's Election and Objection Committee and eventually, the National Labor Relations
                Board. There is correspondence, election material such as ballots, the documents
                used as evidence for the protest and appeal process, the Appeal Committee decision,
                and the charges that were filed with the Nation Labor Relations Board. Shaw claimed
                that in June 1971, union officers and representatives restrained and coerced him,
                causing him to be discriminated by his employer Ann Page Manufacturing.</p>
