            <p>Brownie Lee Jones served as director of the Southern School for Workers (originally
                named the Southern Summer School for Women Workers) from 1944 until the school's
                dissolution in 1950. Although originally established exclusively for the labor
                education of women workers, and the school began admitting male workers in 1938. By
                the end of the Second World War, however, many of the functions performed by the
                Southern School were being taken over by the national labor organizations, thus
                diminishing demand for the school's services. In response, the school, under the
                leadership of Jones, began to diversify its activities, particularly moving into the
                field of civil rights. The school closed in 1950 as a result of financial insolvency
                (1949-1951).</p>

                ability of school to attract donations; placement of labor educators in North and
                South Carolina; "reaction" engulfing the South; work of school in promoting
                interracial cooperation, such as Civil Rights Committee in Richmond; schools support
                for anti-segregation legislation and growing animosity of political right to the
                school; CIO labor education school in Maryland; recruiting of blacks in Virginia;
                reluctance of white workers to work with black workers; SSW school on government in
