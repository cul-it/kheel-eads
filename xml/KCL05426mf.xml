            <p>The growth of a liberal society during the Nineteenth Century is epitomized in the
                life of George Jacob Holyoake, 1817-1906. The numerous stages in his career, from
                that of despised atheist to that of respected Liberal journalist and propagator of
                International Co-operation, touch on many of the social and intellectual
                developments of the Victorian age. </p>
            <p>An Owenite Lecturer and latter-day Chartist, Holyoake took a leading part in the Free
                Press struggle, and the abolition of the compulsory oath in courts of law. An active
                friend of foreign revolutionaries and a prominent supporter of Italian unification,
                above all, he was a founder, and the most important propagator of the Cooperative
                and Co-partnership Movements, both at home and abroad. He was, in addition, involved
                in scores of lesser agitations, and was a Parliamentary lobbyist par excellence. </p>
            <p>The work of his lifetime was liberalism, the practical working out of Mill's famous
                "Essay": freedom to express beliefs and shape public opinion; civil rights for all,
                irrespective of beliefs and class, and that degree of economic freedom which he
                believed true Co-operation could bring. Intellectually, he enjoyed the friendships
                of J.S. Mill and F. W. Newman, both of whom influenced his own thought and outlook,
                and his correspondents included Joseph Cowen, Joseph Mazzini, Robert Owen, Mr.
                Gladstone, Sir John Macdonald, Justin McCarthy and numerous leading Radical and
                Co-operative Members of Parliament, such as W. Morrison, C.W. Dilke, J. Chamberlain,
                S. A. Beaumont, etc. </p>
            <p>As a founder of the "Leader" newspaper in 1850, he provided a link between the
                emerging working-classes, never very religious and the middle-class intellectuals,
                who were beginning to express their now much publicized doubts. The historian of
                working-class organizations and co-operation, of Liberalism and Liberty, of
                intellectual history and Victorian moralism, will find a mine of information and
                suggestions in this extensive correspondence. </p>
            <p>The Bishopsgate Institute collection is complementary to that in Manchester,
                highlighting specific episodes and movements. The diaries give a brief chronology of
                Holyoake's movements, lectures and friends, but the log books, lecture notes, etc.,
                provide a much fuller picture of the artisan culture and ethos of self- education,
                which existed in Birmingham in the late 1830's. The documents on Italy, the Taxes on
                Knowledge and the Gravelling Tax Abolition Committee, supply details of three of the
                movements which are typical of Holyoake's works.</p>
