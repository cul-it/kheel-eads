			<p>At the request of the Commissioner of Labor the New York State Board of Mediation and Arbitration convened in Gloversville on October 5, 1914 to attempt to settle the glove cutters strike which had idled 1500 men in 150 plants. Members of the
				Board included Mr. William C, Rogers, chief mediator; Mr. James C. McManus; and Mr. P.S. Downey. </p>
			<p>On August 21, 1914 the glove cutters held a mass meeting in which they voted to ask the Glove Manufacturers Association for an increase of 25 cents per dozen on men's and boys' gloves and 20 cents per dozen on ladies' gloves. The glove cutters
				were earning an average of $13.30 per week and had not had an increase in wages for 17 years. The glove cutters struck when the manufacturers turned down the request for an increase. Since glove making was the only industry in Fulton County the
				Board was instructed to investigate the situation. During the course of the strike several employers settled with their employees for 15 cents a dozen, and the Board recommended that the strikers return to work and continue negotiations for an
				increase of not less than 15 cents. The Board's proposals were turned down by the men.</p>
