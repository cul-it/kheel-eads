            <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
                unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
                about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
                first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played a
                key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally
                referred to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope,
                membership size, and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces
                in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's
                garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its
                members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care
                facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The
                ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form
                the Union of Needle trades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged
                with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a
                new union known as UNITE HERE. The two unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented
                only 250,000 workers between them, down from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000
                in 1969.</p>
        </bioghist>
        <bioghist encodinganalog="MARC 545">
            
            <p>The ILGWU Auditing Department was organized in October 1914, under the direction of
                B.M. Rabinovitch. It was charged with auditing the local unions, joint boards,
                district councils and departments, and the general office of the ILGWU. The
                Department presented these reports to the General Executive Board and to the ILGWU's
                International conventions.</p>
        </bioghist>
        <scopecontent encodinganalog="MARC 520">
            
            <p>Beginning in 1935, the ILGWU published annual financial reports that accounted for
                the International office's receipts and disbursements, as well as those of affiliate
                local unions, joint boards, district councils and departments. These reports
                detailed the disbursements from the local unions, joint boards, and district
                councils and departments to the international office (dues stamps and assessments),
                administrative expenses (salaries for office staff, office rent, printing,
                stationary, postage, telephone and telegraph, janitor, cleaning, light, dues to
                other organizations, miscellaneous expenses), organization expenses (salaries for
                managers, business agents, adjusters, organizing expenses, elections, strike relief,
                legal fees, loss of time, collection of dues, education, hall rent, advertisements,
                etc.), and donations and relief (such as the Anti-Nazi drive, labor causes,
                charitable, community, or cultural organizations). Local unions also paid towards
                the operation of the joint boards of which they were member organizations. </p>
            <p>Reporting was again altered in 1958. Before then, whether in the convention report or
                an annual report, the union's financial information was presented in tables that
                listed local unions by number, followed by joint boards, district council and
                departments, and finally, the international office. After 1958, these presented the
                same information by area (e.g., Northeast Department Area, Southwest Area, etc.),
                and concluded with a listing of joint boards, district councils and department and
                their affiliated locals. </p>
            <p>The Census Reports in this collection provide general information about the
                membership, presenting the annual statistical schedule of dues stamps purchased from
                the international office and a comparison of dues-paying members with actual
                membership census. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Prior to 1935, the ILGWU published information about its membership and finances
                along with reports presented at the international conventions. These reports
                provided membership numbers, broken down by male or female and also by number of
                members working by week or by piece. They also detailed the amounts local unions
                paid out and collected. In addition, some of these reports included brief summaries
                of strikes (e.g., won, lost, pending, number involved, cost, and gains),
                injunctions, and general conditions in the trade. Such additional financial and
                membership information may be found in financial and statistical reports in 5780/193
                PUBS and 5780/121 PUBS. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Taken together, the reports in this collection provide a statistical overview of the
                membership and finances of the ILGWU. Researchers interested in the more detailed
                information on these aspects of the union, or on the membership and finances of
                specific local unions, joint boards, and district councils and departments, should
                consult finding aids to those affiliates' records.</p>
