			<p>Gonic Manufacturing was founded in 1859 by Nicholas Varney Whitehouse, after his previous business venture in Gonic, N.H., had failed. During the Civil War the high demand for wool uniforms and blankets by the Union Army meant that business was
				good for the company, which used some of their profits to improve the mill's water power and add steam engines. In 1861 a large addition was added to the west end of the mill. </p>
			<p>The 1870s saw a drop in the demand for wool, and a warehouse fire destroy much of Gonic's finished material. After Whitehouse's retirement in 1877 and a weavers' strike the mill closed in 1878. After economic conditions improved the mill
				reopened in 1880. </p>
			<p>By the 1890s a residence for the mill agent and 30 tenements for workers were included in the company's holdings. Although the mill stayed in operation through the Depression, it had to sell many of its tenements in 1935. </p>
			<p>World War II saw Gonic Manufacturing fulfilling U.S. Navy orders for blankets and other material, earning it the a "Navy E" award. </p>
			<p>During the 1940s and 1950s demand was such that the mill was expanded and improved. The 1960s, however, saw a decline in demand, due in part to the increased use of synthetic fibers. </p>
			<p>Gonic Manufacturing Compnay ceased operations and closed in 1971.</p>
