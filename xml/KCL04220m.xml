            <p>March 12, 1908 - September 5, 2003 </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Milton Konvitz, a Cornell University faculty member and authority on constitutional
                and labor law, and civil and human rights, died Sept. 5 at the age of 95. Konvitz
                was a founding faculty member in the School of Industrial and Labor Relations from
                1946 until his retirement in 1973. He was also a professor in Cornell's Law School. </p>
            <p>Konvitz is perhaps best known for his American Ideals course, which he taught to more
                than 8,000 students over the course of his career, never giving the same lecture
                twice. "I saw the U.S. Constitution as it has been interpreted as a magnificent
                depository of our ideals, both individual and social," he said. His course exposed
                students to the great intellectual thinkers and philosophers throughout history
                whose writings had shaped those ideals. They included Sophocles, whose play Antigone
                is Cornell's New Student Reading Project this year. One student he influenced was
                U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Cornell Class of 1954, who considers
                him a mentor. </p>
            <p>At Cornell Konvitz also was a founder of the university's Department of Near Eastern
                Studies and Program of Jewish Studies. "I felt it was essential for a college
                interested in the humanities not to leave out Hebrew language and literature," he
                said. "And the knowledge of Jewish history, which began 4,000 years ago and has
                contributed to civilization no less than Greek, Roman or English history, is
                important to today's students -Jewish and non-Jewish." He often hosted students at
                his Ithaca home and helped start the first Kosher dining option at Cornell, Young
                Israel House. </p>
            <p>In addition, for nearly 30 years he directed the Liberian Codification Project, which
                drew up the official body of statutory laws that is still in force in the Republic
                of Liberia today, despite the current political upheaval there. Konvitz also edited
                the opinions of Liberia's Supreme Court and received the Grand Band of the Order of
                the Star of Africa, the highest award given to foreigners, as well as an honorary
                degree from the University of Liberia, one of seven honorary degrees he received in
                his lifetime. </p>
            <p>Active as a scholar and writer until his death, he wrote books and articles on
                American constitutional law that won him wide recognition and were cited in U.S.
                Supreme Court opinions. Among his nine books is Fundamental Liberties of a Free
                People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly, which was republished earlier this year
                with an expanded introduction by him that is strongly critical of the Rehnquist
                Supreme Court. Other books include A Century of Civil Rights (1983) and Judaism and
                Human Rights (2nd ed. 2001). He also edited a dozen volumes, including two on
                American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose thinking shaped his views. One
                Emersonian idea he absorbed was that readers give life to books, which Konvitz
                recast as follows: "It is in their hearing that students bring life to the words,
                the thoughts, the teacher." </p>
            <p>Konvitz was born in Safed, Palestine (now Israel ), in 1908, the son of a rabbi. He
                immigrated to the United States in 1915 and became a naturalized citizen in 1926. He
                received a bachelor's degree in 1929 and a law degree in 1930, both from New York
                University, and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Cornell in 1933. Before joining Cornell's
                faculty, he was one of three assistant general counsels to Thurgood Marshall at the
                NAACP Legal Defense Fund for three years. </p>
            <p>He is survived by his wife, Mary, of Oakhurst, N.J.; a brother, Phillip, of Elberon,
                N.J.; a son and daughter-in-law, Josef and Isa, of Paris, France; and two grandsons,
                Eli and Ezra. Josef Konvitz, who grew up in Ithaca, is now an official at the
                Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p>
