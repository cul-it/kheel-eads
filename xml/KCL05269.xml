			<head id="a5" altrender="organizational history">ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY </head>
			<p>The National Association of Post Office Craftsmen was founded in 1882 when J. Holt
				Greene, a clerk in the Louisville, Kentucky, post office began corresponding with
				other post offices throughout the country in an effort to promote a national
				convention of postal clerks to be held in Washington. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Between 1882 and 1890, several local organizations of postal clerks were established
				and two conventions were called to establish contacts between the independent
				associations. In 1890, the New York organization issued a call to all first-class
				post offices to send delegates to a national convention. Delegates assembled in
				Washington and formed the National Association of Post Office Clerks [NAPOC].
				Eight-hour day, fifteen-day vacation, and salary classification bills were drawn and
				submitted to Congress. The vacation bill was passed that same year, but the hours
				and classification bills could not get out of committee. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>At the second convention of the NAPOC in 1891, a legislative committee was created to
				lobby on the organization's behalf. The legislative committee of NAPOC lobbied
				vigorously and persistently during 1892 and 1903, but with little success. Their
				efforts led to the Postmaster General to issue an order forbidding any "Postmaster,
				Post-office Clerk, Letter Carrier, Railway Postal Clerk, or other postal employee"
				from travelling to Washington to lobby Congress. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>During the convention of 1897, a factional dispute arose in the NAPOC that arose in
				part because of the NAPOC's failure to secure legislation and disagreement on how
				best to circumvent the Postmaster General's order. The granting of membership to
				supervisory employees was also an issue. Locals from Chicago, Philadelphia,
				Pittsburgh, and San Francisco withdrew from the National Association and together
				with a large group from New York formed the United Association of Post Office
				Clerks. In 1899 the two groups merged back into one organization, now called the
				United National Association of Post Office Clerks [UNAPOC]. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1900, a group of Chicago postal workers organized and affiliated themselves with
				the AFL; because of this affiliation, the Chicago local was denied entrance to
				UNAPOC. UNAPOC refused to affiliate with the larger labor movement both because of
				their status as federal employees and because they preferred to work "in such a way
				as to conciliate and never embarrass the [Postal] Department." However, this became
				problematic when President Theodore Roosevelt issued an executive order forbidding
				federal employees to lobby for pay raises or benefits except through their
				departmental supervisors. This became known as the "gag order" and essentially
				stopped UNAPOC's lobbying efforts entirely. The "gag order" was strengthened by
				Roosevelt in 1906 and was later reinforced by President Taft. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The 1905 convention was marked by factional strife and the delegates of thirty-five
				locals withdrew from the convention. It was felt that since UNAPOC was silenced in
				Congress, the clerks should find another way to represent their interests. In August
				1906, locals in San Francisco, Milwaukee, and Louisville, joined the independent
				Chicago group and formed the National Federation of Post Office Clerks [NFPOC]. They
				were granted a charter by the AFL. The "gag order" was repealed in 1912 under the
				Lloyd-LaFollette Act, leaving UNAPOC and NFPOC in competition and hostile towards
				each other. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1917, the Brotherhood of Railway Postal Clerks merged with the National Federation
				in the AFL and from this time on, the Federation claimed to be the leading clerks
				organization with UNAPOC dwindling slowly over the years. The National Association
				of Letter Carriers and the Railway Mail Association also affiliated with the AFL in
				1917. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>During the 1920s, the AFL postal groups actively opposed the Postal Department while
				advocating for their members; UNAPOC assumed a conciliatory attitude. The Harding
				Administration had placed itself on record as opposing AFL affiliation for
				government employees and UNAPOC adopted policies calculated to win Departmental
				favor. For many years UNAPOC considered itself a "professional organization" and not
				a "trade union." </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1931, UNAPOC and the NFPOC again met in merger discussions initiated by UNAPOC.
				The Association had for many years advocated one big union of all postal employee as
				a matter of principle, but these discussions fell apart because of the Association's
				insistence that a merged organization would have to abandon the AFL. However, the
				1930s and 1940s were marked by a decline in membership even as UNAPOC continued to
				lobby on behalf of its members and to provide them with benefits. It also lost lost
				its enmity toward the labor movement and took its place as a genuine independent
				union. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1948, UNAPOC again called for a single union for all postal employees and opened
				its membership to other postal employees. In 1956, the name of the organization was
				changed to the United National Association of Post Office Craftsmen to more
				accurately describe its scope and ambition. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1961, UNAPOC and the NFPOC merged to close the split of over fifty years in the
				ranks of the post office clerks. They were joined by the United Postal Workers and
				the National Postal Transport Association and together they formed the United
				Federation of Post Office Clerks, AFL-CIO.</p>
