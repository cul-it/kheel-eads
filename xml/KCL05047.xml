            <p>On January 21, 1958, the president appointed an Emergency Board to hear the dispute
                between Eastern Air Lines and its Flight Engineers. The Board consisted of David L.
                Cole, chairman, Saul Wallen and Dudley E. Whiting. The same people wereappointed to
                hear the dispute between Eastern Air Lines and the Pilots (Emergency Board #121)
                since one of the main issues in dispute in both cases was about whether the flight
                engineer should come from the engineers or the pilots. </p>
            <p>The Flight Engineers wanted a specific guarantee that Eastern Air Lines would use
                only Flight Engineers on its larger aircraft, which required a third man who was
                responsible for the mechanical functions of the operation of the aircraft.
                Inaddition the Engineers wanted Improved pensions, wages, vacation time, traveling
                expenses and some others.</p>
