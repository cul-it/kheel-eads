            <p>The foundation for this proceedings was to be found in a so-called moratorium
                provision in the agreements signed by the parties in 1951 and 1952. The moratoruim
                provided for wage adjustments when the wage stabilization policy permitted so-called
                annual improvement wage increases. A referee was to be appointed by the President if
                the parties were unable to agree that a wage increase was justified. The President
                appointed Paul N. Guthrie as referee on December 1, 1952. The referee decided that
                this proceeding had power to determine only three issues. First, whether further
                wage increases were justified; second, If so, what such increases should be; and
                third, the effective date thereof. Hearings were held and voluminous data
                accumulated according to the report, but this collection contains only the printed
                items listed below.</p>
