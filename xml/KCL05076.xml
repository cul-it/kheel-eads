            <p>The Railroad Marine Workers Commission was appointed March 24, 1961 by the President
                under his general powers to make re-ccrrjnendation;-, concerning the dispute over
                manning requirements aboard railroad owned tug boats and ferries in New York harbor. </p>
            <p>The dispute began in 1959 over changes in the collective bargain-ing agreement and
                covered a wide range of wage, fringe benefits and rules changes. Emergency Board
                Number 133 was appointed, and made a number of recommendations with respect to the
                issues in dispute. On the matter of the resolution of controversies involving the
                elimination of positions or of classifications of work it suggested a 60 day notice
                during which time the parties could negotiate on the changes. </p>
            <p>Negotiations were unsuccessful and on January 10,1961 a work stoppage was put into
                effect. On January 23, 1961 the parties accepted a joint recommendation of the U.S.
                Secretary of Labor, the Governor of New York State and the Mayor of Mew York City.
                It orovided for the reconstitution of the Presidential Hail-road Commission 60 days
                after it had submitted its findings in the dispute involving the railroad
                brotherhoods and the major U.S. railroads. </p>
            <p>The members of the Railroad Marine Workers Commission were formally appointed by the
                President on February 9, 1962. The public members were Isador Lubin, chairman, Lloyd
                H. Bailer and Vernon H. Jensen. L.B. Fee, J.J. Gaherin ana J.H. Maher represented
                the carriers and Captain John M. Bishop, G.P. McGinty and Ned R. Phillips
                represented the employee organizations. Eleven sessions of public hearings were held
                and the commission members made observation trips to the waterfront.</p>
