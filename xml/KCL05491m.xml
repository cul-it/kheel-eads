            <p>Labor activist, union organizer, social theorist and Trotskyite. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>George Saul was active in the union movement during the 1920s, 1930s, and early
                1940s. During this period, Saul was involved in a number of significant struggles
                between labor and capital, including the I.W.W.-led strike of miners against the
                Rockefeller owned Colorado Fuel and Iron Company in 1927 and the communist-led
                strike of textile workers in Gastonia, N.C. in 1929. He was also involved in
                organizing Ford employees in Detroit in the 1930s and early 1940s. While a member of
                the United Automobile Workers (CIO), Saul was constantly at odds with the union
                leadership and, as a result, left the union movement shortly after the end of World
                War II. Saul was also active in the Communist Party during the 1920s, turning to
                Trotskyism in the 1930s because of disagreements with the party leadership over
                tactics and general principles.</p>

        <scopecontent encodinganalog="MARC 520">
            
            <p>Consists of a single draft of an uncompleted autobiography. The bulk of the
                autobiography concerns Saul's life prior to his becoming involved with the union
                movement. The aspects of Saul's life discussed include his childhood in Colorado,
                his experiences in the army during World War I, and his years as a college student
                in Dvner during the 1920s. The latter part of the manuscript cursorily covers Saul's
                union activities, including his participation in the Colorado Fuel and Iron and
                Gastonia strikes. Also included in the latter part is a brief discussion of the
                formation of the UAW in Detroit. The manuscript also briefly covers the impact of
                the Sacco and Vanzetti case on the development of Saul's radicalism; the need to
                organize black workers, particularly in the South; the author's reasons for leaving
                the union movment; and his reasons for defecting to Trotskyism.</p>
