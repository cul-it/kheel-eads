			<p>Paul F. Brissenden was born in Benzonia, Michigan on September 21, 1885. After completing his preparatory education at the Warren Academy in 1904, he enrolled at the </p>

			<p>Paul Brissenden also served as the chairman of the board of directors of the International Consumers League (1939-1940) and as a member of the board of directors of the International Rescue and Relief Committee beginning in 1940. As an
				arbitrator, he faithfully served as a member of the panel of the New York State Board of Mediation, American Arbitration Association and the U.S. Conciliation Service. He was a charter member of the National Academy of Arbitrators. </p>
