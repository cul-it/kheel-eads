			<p>The New York, Chicago, and St. Louis Railway Company, more commonly known as the
				Nickel Plate Road [NKP], was founded in 1881. It ran along the southern shore of the
				Great Lakes, connecting Buffalo to Chicago, running through Cleveland and Fort
				Wayne. The Nickel Plate Road was a successful railroad, operating over 1600 miles of
				track in the Midwestern region of the United States at its peak. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1916, the Van Sweringen brothers purchased the Nickel Plate; they then expanded
				their railroad through the acquisitions of the Lake Erie and Western Railroad and
				the Toledo, St. Louis and Western Railroad, which was known as the Cloverleaf. These
				purchases expanded the reach of the Nickel Plate to Peoria, Illinois and to St.
				Louis and Toledo, respectively. The three lines were consolidated into one company
				in 1923. An additional consolidation with the Pere Marquette Railway and the
				Chesapeake and Ohio railroad was proposed in 1924, but was ultimately rejected by
				the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1926. In 1949, the Nickel Plate Road signed a
				ninety-nine year lease for the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad, granting it access
				to the mid-Atlantic states and the coal fields located there. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The Nickel Plate remained a solvent business through the 1950s, but in 1964 due to
				the increasing financial pressures on the railroad industry, it merged with six
				other railroads into the Norfolk and Western Railroad.</p>

			<p>The collection contains records from the Nickel Plate Road. The bulk of the records
				are grievance reports filed by the employees' unions, and then the resulting
				correspondence between company managers, superintendents, union representatives, and
				the employees. Extensive internal communication between various divisions of the
				Nickel Plate is also documented. The correspondence also contains documentation of
				the various rules and regulations that are were agreed upon between the management
				and unions in their contracts. Other agreements include those between various
				railroad unions and both the Pere Marquette Railway Company and the Lake Erie and
				Western Railroad, both of which were controlled by the then owners of the Nickel
				Plate Road. Of particular interest is the twenty-six year grievance process
				regarding the types of seating present in the train engines, and which class of
				employee had rights to which particular seat; these records include hand-drawn
				renderings of the types of seats thought to be appropriate by various interested
				parties.</p>
