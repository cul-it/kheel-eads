			<p>The Transport Workers Union of America [TWU] was founded by New York City subway
				workers in 1934, and then expanded to represent other transit employees across the
				United States. Their largest Local is Local 100, whose membership consists of New
				York City's mass transit workers. TWU also represents flight attendants, grounds
				crew, and maintenance workers for a number of airlines as well as employees of
				Amtrak, ConRail, and a few short line railroads. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The TWU was one of the first unions to join the Congress of Industrial Relations
				[CIO], and was known for its left-leaning politics. One of TWU's founders and its
				first president, Mike Quill, was a close ally of the Communist Party USA before
				renouncing all ties in 1948. The TWU was also unique among railroad and transit
				unions in that it fostered close ties with the African-American community and the
				NAACP, included quotas for the hiring of African-Americans in its collective
				bargaining agreements, and supported a strong civil rights platform which advocated
				for a national platform to combat racism as well as combating the racism found among
				its own members. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>TWU started representing railway employees in 1954 when the United Railroad Workers
				of America [URRWA] on the Pennsylvania Railroad [PRR] voted to join the TWU. The
				URRWA was itself an outgrowth of the CIO's United Railway Organizing Committee,
				which was chartered in 1941 to organize non-operating employees on the railways. The
				Committee organized many different non-operating crafts, including carmen, car
				inspectors, food service workers, maintenance of way, and maintenance of equipment
				employees. Like the TWU, the URRWA was committed to strong union ideals, promoting
				racial equality, fighting discrimination, and serving as a counterpoint to the
				railroad brotherhoods of the AFL. The URRWA represented around 40,000 employees of
				the Pennsylvania Railroad; in order to increase their negotiating power, the
				Committee voted to affiliate with the TWU, thus forming the Railroad Division of the
				TWU. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In the TWU's first two decades of existence, the International Executive Board was
				the highest governing authority in between conventions. The Board consisted of the
				International officers as well as members at large and met quarterly. In the 1950s,
				after the growth of the union, a smaller executive body was needed for efficiency's sake.
				The International Executive Council was established, and it took over most of the
				duties previously held by the Board, which now met only once a year.</p>
