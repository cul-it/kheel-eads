   <head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
   <p>This collection consists of two series: Series A, 5 inch by 7 inch glass plate negatives, approximately 1,500; and Series B, 8 inch by 10 inch glass plate negatives, approximately 2,000. </p>
   <p>Many of the photographs in Series A depict company outings, or "Field Days." These events were most likely organized by the Draper Company and may have consisted entirely of Draper Company employees. Founders of the Draper Company, brothers George and
    Ebenezer Draper were responsible for creating an integrated, planned community with innovative employee housing and recreational spaces, in addition to employment. </p>
   <p>Series B consists largely of machinery built by the Draper Company. Also included are photographs of the company plant, employee housing, recreational facilities, and the surrounding area. </p>
   <p>All negatives in this collection have been printed, please see collection 6612 P: Draper Corporation Photographs. Of the roughly 3,500 negatives 513 have been described at the individual level. Those descriptions are available in the container lists for
    both this collection and collection 6612 P.</p>

      <p>Negative no.A994. 1891-1895. Image depicts a view of the Temple Shop at the Draper Company in Hopedale, Massachusetts The view shows a counter along the windows on the right and machinery, including lathes, on the left. A temple is a device on a loom
       located near the fell of the cloth, one on each side; temples hold the cloth out as wide as possible during the process of weaving and prevent it from being drawn in too much by the filling. See Negative 1000, in this box, for a view of the Temple Shop
       with a dozen employees and taken from the opposite angle as this one. The Temple Shop was built in 1868 for W. W. Dutcher. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. See box 4, folder 1065 for a very similar shot. 5 x 7 in. See
       Collection 6612 P, Box 1, Folder 5, Item 994 for print of this negative.</p>

       The house is three stories with multiple gables. Another house is to the left, further in the background. Eben Sumner Draper (1858-1914) was a leading figure in what later became the Draper Corporation, and served as the governor of Massachusetts between
       1909 and 1911. Original photograph by the Draper Company. 5 x 7 in. See Collection 6612 P, Box 1, Folder 5, Item 997 for print of this negative.</p>

      <p>Negative no.A999. 1891-1895. Image depicts a view of the Drafting Room at the Draper Company in Hopedale, Massachusetts Four male employees are visible; three sitting at drafting tables, and one leaning against a cabinet of drawers in the rear. Two
       framed prints hang on the wall in the rear with others propped up on the cabinet of drawers. The man seated on the left is dressed in a three-piece suit and wears a hat; he also holds a shuttle in his hands. The man leaning in the back also wears a
       three-piece suit and a hat. The man second to the left wears a vest but not a suit jacket; the man on the right wears a three-piece suit. Although taken from the same angle as seen in Box 3, Negative 1051, the arrangement of furniture is different, and
       this photo was probably taken at a different time. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. 5 x 7 in. See Collection 6612 P, Box 1, Folder 5, Item 999 for print of this negative.</p>

       temple is a device on a loom located near the fell of the cloth, one on each side; temples hold the cloth out as wide as possible during the process of weaving and prevent it from being drawn in too much by the filling. See Negative 994, in this box,
       for a view of the Temple Shop without employees and taken from the opposite angle as this one. The Temple Shop was built in 1868 for W. W. Dutcher, a three-story brick factory on Social Street. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery,
       primarily looms. 5 x 7 in. See Collection 6612 P, Box 1, Folder 5, Item 1000 for print of this negative.</p>

       located near the fell of the cloth, one on each side; temples hold the cloth out as wide as possible during the process of weaving and prevent it from being drawn in too much by the filling. See Box 1, Negative 1000 for a view of the Temple Shop with a
       dozen employees and taken from the opposite angle as this one. The Temple Shop was built in 1868 for W. W. Dutcher. The Draper Company manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms. See Box 1, Negative 994 for a very similar shot. 5 x 7 in. See

      <p>Negative no.A169. 1901-1916. Image depicts two houses on Bancroft Parkway. The house on the left is a substantial two-and-a- half story wood-shingled house; it has two separate entrances, although only one can be seen here. The house on the right,
       which is somewhat hidden by trees, is a wood-shingled duplex with two porches (see Box 13, Negative 155 for a better view of this house). Both houses have shutters at all the windows (some of them are closed). The unpaved road curves around and there is
       a horse and wagon stopped in front of the house on the right. These two houses can also be seen in the background of Negative 177, in this box. These houses were built for Draper Company employees. 5 x 7 in. See Collection 6612 P, Box 2, Folder 2, Item

       to a set of steps at the rear of the house as well. All the windows have shutters. This house is probably the one that appears in Negative 176, in this box. The house on the right is not quite as large and in a different style, but is also most likely a
       duplex, as Hopedale housing built for Draper Company employees was not generally larger than a duplex. This house is also two-and-a-half stories and is wood-shingled; it does not, however, have shutters which is unusual for Draper Company housing
       (possibly the house is not quite finished). The two houses appear to be bisected by another road on which there are more houses as glimpses of two other houses can be seen behind the house on the left. The road is wide and unpaved; one electric pole
       stands at the side of the road. See Box 15, Negative 182 for another view of these houses. These houses were built for Draper Company employees. 5 x 7 in. See Collection 6612 P, Box 2, Folder 2, Item 173 for print of this negative.</p>

       under construction. No windows or shutters have been installed on that side, and there are two ladders leaning against the porch roof. (Notes in the accession folder indicate the boardinghouse was "doubled" which may account for the unfinished aspects
       of it.) A front porch runs the length of the building. The sign "Hopedale House," which can be seen in Box 22, Negative 343 and Negative 344 has not yet been installed, all of which suggests a date closer to 1903 than 1905, the date for both Negative

       the street, but they have not yet been connected as either electric or telegraph poles (the pole closest to the boardinghouse is an electric pole, connected to the boardinghouse). It is possible this image was taken before the park had been fully
       established and the park and surrounding area had been landscaped. Image taken from a high angle, probably a second- or third-story window. See also Negative 206, in this box. Original photograph by the Draper Company. 5 x 7 in. See Collection 6612 P,

      <p>Negative no.A336. September 6, 1905. Image depicts a view of units 7 through 14 at Prospect Heights in Milford, Massachusetts The units are connected townhouse style, with eight separate entrances (two are double, the others are single), and are made
       out of brick. The entire building is two stories with a small window visible in the third story on each end. There are chimneys on each end, in the middle, and two in the rear. Another set of connected townhouses can be glimpsed on the right. Grass
       plots line the front, separated by walkways to each entrance. A large grassy area is in the foreground. Prospect Heights was built as housing for Draper Company employees, but most houses in Prospect Heights were brick, as opposed to the wooden housing
       found in Hopedale, Massachusetts The houses are believed to have been designed by Peabody &amp; Stearns. See Box 11, Negative 119 for what appears to be another view of these same units, and Box 23, Negative 346 for what appears to be an almost
       identical view taken September 29, 1905. 5 x 7 in. See Collection 6612 P, Box 3, Folder 1, Item 336 for print of this negative.</p>

       crossing the line at approximately the same spot; two more men are behind them. Spectators line the race course, mostly men near the finish but many ladies can be seen further away. Founders of the Draper Company, brothers George and Ebenezer, were
       responsible for creating an integrated, planned community with innovative employee housing and recreational spaces and company events, in addition to employment. 5 x 7 in. See Collection 6612 P, Box 5, Folder 5, Item 915 for print of this negative.</p>

      <p>Negative no.A916. August 9, 1919. Image depicts two men handling a wet hose as part of some sort of competition, most likely as part of a "Field Day" organized by the Draper Corporation for Draper Corporation employees. The man in the straw hat,
       kneeling off to the right, is an official of some kind (he is also seen in Negative 901, in this box). Spectators (mostly young boys) look on behind. It is unclear if "town dept." refers to a dept. of some sort in the Draper Corporation, or whether
       these were town employees competing against Draper employees--see Negative 901, in this box, for the "Shop Dept." participating in the same competition. Founders of the Draper Company, brothers George and Ebenezer, were responsible for creating an
       integrated, planned community with innovative employee housing and recreational spaces and company events, in addition to employment. 5 x 7 in. See Collection 6612 P, Box 5, Folder 5, Item 916 for print of this negative.</p>

      <p>Negative no.A917. August 9, 1919. Image depicts men playing doubles tennis, most likely as part of a "Field Day" organized by the Draper Corporation for Draper Corporation employees. Two of the men are in the far court (one close to the net, the other
       in the back court), while one man is positioned in the near court, close to the net. The fourth player is not visible but may be in the backcourt on the right out of the photographer's range. Spectators watch from the sidelines in the background.

       for its inventor, who had emigrated from Keighley, Yorkshire, England in 1881. Northrup invented the first fully automatic loom, its basic feature being the filling-changing battery. Northrup looms were first marketed by Draper in 1894. Nothrup retired
       to California at the age of 42; as he appears to be in his late fifties or early sixties in this portrait, it is most likely a photograph of another photograph. 8 x 10 in. See Collection 6612 P, Box 11, Folder 6, Item 2204 for print of this

       advertising purposes. The "Atlantic Mill" referred to on the reverse of the print is probably the Atlantic Cotton Mills in Lawrence, Massachusetts, which were cotton mills. The Atlantic Mills were idle by 1913 and dismantled in March 1915. This loom may
       be been used in or at least sold to the Atlantic Cotton Mills by Draper, which was located in Hopedale, Massachusetts 8 x 10 in. See Collection 6612 P, Box 11, Folder 6, Item 2227 for print of this negative.</p>

       front entry with a walkway to the sidewalk and street. Shrubs and climbing vines surround the porch and house. Ballou (1803-1890) was a prominent proponent of pacifism, socialism and abolitionism, and the founder (in 1842) of the Hopedale Community, a
       utopian community blending a factory town with a religious-based commune. George and Ebenezer Draper withdrew their 75% of the community stock in 1856 to establish the Hopedale Manufacturing Company. Ballou continued on as Universalist pastor until
       retirement in 1880. The house was moved from its original location in 1900 to Dutcher Street and the porch added to the building. See Box 15, Negative 188 and Negative 199 for views of the house in its original location at Peace and Hopedale streets.

      <p>Negative no.B160. May 12, 1903. Image depicts a three-story stone building situated on the corner of Hopedale Street (in front of the building) and another, unknown street on the right. The building was designed by architect Fred Swasey of Milford and
       built in 1886; note the cornerstone with the phrase "anno domini" and the date in Roman numerals. The building appears to be in the Romanesque style, somewhat similar to that of H. H. Richardson. The building has two chimneys and a gabled roof with
       decorative ironwork running along the upper edge. There are three entrances at the front, one of which is to the post office (note the two windows labeled "Post Office") and another to the left to another business. The curved archway is probably the

      <p>Negative no.B190. Image depicts a line of houses in Prospect Heights, Milford, Massachusetts The first in the line is a series of connected townhouses, with eight total entrances. The next house appears to be detached (there are two small children in
       front of it), and then a second set of connected townhouses, with a detached house beyond that, etc. These are two-story brick buildings designed to accommodate multiple families. These buildings feature Tudor-style timbering in the gables on the end
       building, roofed entrances (some single, some double), and shutters at all the windows (some closed). There are small lawns in front between the houses and the street. Open space is in the foreground. Prospect Heights was built as housing for Draper
       Company employees, but most houses in Prospect Heights were brick, as opposed to the wooden housing found in Hopedale, Massachusetts The houses are believed to have been designed by Peabody &amp; Stearns. See Box 22, Negative 340 for a closer view
       of the end houses. 8 x 10 in. See Collection 6612 P, Box 12, Folder 5, Item 190 for print of this negative.</p>

      <p>Negative no.B193. May 11, 1903. Image depicts a row of connected townhouses in Prospect Heights, Milford, Massachusetts, with a total of six entrances. These are two-story brick buildings designed to accommodate multiple families. These buildings
       feature roofed entrances and shutters at all the windows (some closed). There are small lawns in front between the houses and the street. Open space is in the foreground. While it would appear that this view is of the front of these houses, the two
       clotheslines filled with laundry across the road suggest this may actually be a rear view of these buildings. Another clothesline filled with laundry can be seen between two buildings on the left. Prospect Heights was built as housing for Draper Company
       employees, but most houses in Prospect Heights were brick, as opposed to the wooden housing found in Hopedale, Massachusetts The houses are believed to have been designed by Peabody &amp; Stearns. Founders of the Draper Company, brothers George and
       Ebenezer Draper were responsible for creating an integrated, planned community with innovative employee housing and recreational spaces and events, in addition to employment. 8 x 10 in. See Collection 6612 P, Box 12, Folder 5, Item 193 for print of this

      <p>Negative no.B194. August 28, 1903. Image depicts a street of substantial two-story, wood-shingled houses. The house in the center right has a porch on the side and is probably a two-family, with an entrance on the other side of the house as well. The
       second house from the left is also a two-family with two entrances. Most of these houses are most likely two-family residences. All of the houses have shutters on the windows and lawns with some trees and bushes planted in front of them. The street,
       which curves around the houses, is unpaved but there is a sidewalk. These houses were constructed for employees of the Draper Company. Founders of the Draper Company, brothers George and Ebenezer Draper were responsible for creating an integrated,

      <p>Negative no.B861. February 11, 1911. Image depicts an unidentified male operative demonstrating how mill operatives would suck the thread through the eye of a shuttle. The man holds the shuttle to his mouth; he would use his right hand to draw the
       thread out. Mill operatives would draw the thread through their mouths to help smooth it and make it easier to draw through the eye of the shuttle. However, sucking on cotton thread could eventually cause lung problems and did so in many mill
       operatives. The unidentified man wears work clothes: dark shirt and pants with a light tie. He also wears wire-rimmed glasses. The demonstration takes place in an unidentified mill; the battery of a loom can be seen on the left. He is presumably a
       Draper Company employee. See Negative 862 and Negative 863, in this box, for images of another employee demonstrating this, and Box 179, Negative 870 through Negative 874 for images demonstrating this procedure using a skeleton. As the Draper Company
       manufactured textile machinery, primarily looms, and did not manufacture cloth, it is unclear what relation this photograph has to Draper unless it was to demonstrate something with their looms. 8 x 10 in. See Collection 6612 P, Box 15, Folder 1, Item

       Negative 896 and Negative 897, in this box, for other views of this man in front of the scrap pile taken on this date. See Box 185, Negative 934, Negative 935, and Negative 937 for views of the scrap pile taken a month after this one. The Draper Company
       manufactured textile machinery, which explains the extent of the scrap iron pile. 8 x 10 in. See Collection 6612 P, Box 15, Folder 2, Item 898 for print of this negative.</p>
