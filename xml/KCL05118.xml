			<p>On October 18, 1945, Mayor O'Dwyer of New York City suggested that the use of
				collective bargaining might alleviate the friction between the Board of
				Transportation and the transit employees. It was not until 1950, however, when
				Michael J. Quill, President of the Transport Workers Union, demanded immediate
				contract negotiations with the Board of Transportation, that this issue came to the
				forefront. Quill had circulated a petition among the transit workers calling for
				these negotiations, and claimed that 21,834 of the 27,000 employees had supported
				his stand. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Other T.W.U. demands were a $2-a-day raise for all transit employees, increased
				overtime pay, an improved pension plan, and additional vacation days after five
				years of service. The Greater New York CIO requested that the present grievance
				procedure of the BoT be modified. Conversely, the BoT argued that it did not have
				the funds to meet these demands. Mayor O'Dwyer offered to set up a fact-finding
				board to hear the complaints of each side, and both the Board of Transportation and
				the Transport Workers Union agreed to submit their cases before this impartial
				board. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The Board was appointed by Mayor William O'Dwyer on January 9, 1950. David L. Cole
				was appointed as chairman of the Board, and Theodore W. Kheel, Thomas A. Morgan, and
				Edward P. Mulrooney were appointed as Board members. The hearings began on April 12,
				1950. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The findings of the Board may be found in its printed <extref href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924002357584;view=1up;seq=1;size=175">Report to Honorable William O'Dwyer, Mayor of the City of New York, May 31, 1950</extref>.</p>
