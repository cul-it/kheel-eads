			<p>In 1868 Robert Wolfenden founded the Attleborough Dye Works. Around 1878 he brought his two sons, John W. and Oscar, into the business as partners. It was not until Robert Wolfenden's death that the name of the company was changed to R.
				Wolfenden &amp; Sons. </p>
			<p>By 1930 the company had one of the largest, if not largest, plants in the world that does nothing but dye textiles. At that time they employed about 175 people and could dye 25 tons of fabric per day. </p>
			<p>R. Wolfenden and Sons became a division of J.P. Stevens &amp; Co. in 1949.</p>
		</bioghist>
		<scopecontent encodinganalog="MARC 520">
			
			<p>Images depict, step-by-step, the dyeing process in a 24 photograph series. The series was made circa 1950. Also includes one other photograph of an employee at a drying machine, which is not numbered, but appears to be part of the series.</p>
