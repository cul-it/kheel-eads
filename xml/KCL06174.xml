			<head id="a2" altrender="organizational history">NYSUT ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY</head>
			<p>New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) was created in 1972 by the merger of the New York State Teachers Association (NYSTA) and the United Teachers of New York (UTNY). NYSTA had been affiliated with the National Education Association (NEA), and
				UTNY with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). UTNY was the statewide organization whose United Federation of Teachers (UFT), led by Albert Shanker, was the predominant teachers' union in New York City. In joining with United Teachers and
				affiliating with the AFT, NYSUT also became a member union of the AFL-CIO. </p>
			<p>In 1976, NYSUT voted to disaffiliate with the NEA. Some locals left NYSUT and created the NYEA (New York Educators Association), which became the state affiliate for the NEA. In the early 1980s, NYEA changed its name to NEA-NY. </p>
			<p>NYEA/NEA- NY viewed association with the AFL-CIO's industrial unions as undermining the professional image and independence of teachers. The two organizations also differed strongly on aspects of the governance structure, particularly with
				respect to ethnic minority representation, with NYSUT opposed to mandatory minimums. The rivalry between NYSUT and NYEA/NEA-NY in organizing new locals expended a great deal of resources for both labor organizations. </p>
			<p>While competition with NYEA/NEA-NY was a constant focus of NYSUT's organizing efforts for teachers, NYSUT was also organizing college faculty members, nurses, and other non-teaching personnel. Once members were organized, NYSUT continued to
				advocate for teachers' and other workers' rights through contract support and legal services at the local level and political involvement at the state and federal levels, supporting candidates and legislation that protected funding, due
				process, and working conditions. </p>
			<p>NEA-NY merged with NYSUT in 2006, by which time NYSUT had grown to more than half a million members, becoming the largest union in New York State.</p>

						<abstract>Alan Lubin was executive vice president of NYSUT from 1993 to 2009, after a long career as an officer in NYSUT's New York City affiliate, the United Federation of Teachers; he served on the NYSUT Board of Directors since 1973.
							The executive vice president position oversees the legislative and political programs of NYSUT, including the activities of its political action committee, VOTE/COPE. The correspondence in this series documents the breadth of
							relationships Lubin had with state legislators and agency administrators, party officials (both Republican and Democratic), and advocacy organizations, as well as his detailed command of complex issues affecting public education,
							organized labor, health care and the economy writ large. This knowledge base is also evident in his collection of speeches, which also reveal his willingness to make himself available to locals even at the election district level in
							the promotion of workers' rights..</abstract>

						</unittitle>
						<abstract>The series spans the late 1960s to 1981, with a few documents dating from the 1950s and as early as 1938, but focuses mainly on the early 1970s, the formative years of NYSUT as it emerged from NYSTA (New York State Teachers
							Association) and struggled with the question of unity with the National Education Association (NEA) versus affiliation with the AFL-CIO and the American Federation of Teachers. Issues of professionalism -- respect, recognition, and
							individual autonomy -- clashed with the practical desire for higher wages and benefits that was seen to be achievable only through following the industrial model of traditional labor organization. That tension was perfectly
							articulated in a speech by NYSTA's executive secretary Francis White to the House of Delegates shortly before his resignation, when he warned that the union could not achieve the militancy and effectiveness of the Teamsters without
							the unity and discipline of the Teamsters. In the end, the Board of Directors chose the industrial path, rejecting the elitist pretentions of the NEA, whose sense of exclusivity extended even to barring full membership by
							non-teaching school employees. For years to come, NYSUT and the NEA would exist as competing organizations in New York State, but the political acumen developed out of the conflict by the NYSUT elected officers would serve the union
							well in its dealings with the State Education Department, legislature, and local school boards. The collection includes testimony by officers before the state legislature, records of committees studying educational issues such as
							mainstreaming developmentally disabled students, and internal issues such as awards criteria, as well as the files of the annual conventions (House of Delegates/Representative Assembly). Both NEA and NYSTA/NYSUT board meetings are
							represented..</abstract>

						</unittitle>
						<abstract>NYSUT's field service operation provided ongoing assistance to local teachers associations throughout the state. The department was divided into several geographic regional offices, and field representatives associated with
							each office were assigned to school districts within the area. Assistance focused primarily on contract negotiations and grievances, which frequently involved arbitration and close cooperation with the NYSUT Legal Department. These
							are the files of the NYSUT Mid-Hudson Regional Office, covering the late 1980s through the 1990s. A large section of the files are devoted to Rhinecliff, a Special Act school, one of many created by special acts of the state
							legislature to provide education for students whose disruptive behaviors required their placement outside the mainstream system. Complicating the different funding mechanisms and regulations for staff under Education Law was the
							fact that the district was governed by a religious-affiliated agency, Pius XII Family and Children Services. The files document how adversarial the relationship was between the teacher's union, which struggled with issues of salary
							parity and professional dignity, and the administration, some of whom came not from the public education system but from the state corrections system. No issue -- whether a door had two locks or three -- seemed too trivial to
							challenge either by the teachers or the administration. By contrast, the files of the Wappingers district, a mainstream public school district, are more typical of the orderly negotiations process encountered by the NYSUT field
							representatives (later called labor relations specialists) on behalf of teachers, school bus drivers, and other school related personnel.</abstract>

						</unittitle>
						<abstract>Covers 2006-2010, with a few folders 1988-1991. In addition to records of NYSUT's Division of Research and Educational Services, which fell under the purview of the First Vice President, the files document the activities of

							Standards, and the Education and Learning Trust. Meeting agendas and minutes of these entities are heavily featured, as well as speeches and reports prepared by Neira. Minutes and materials of NYSUT's political action arm,
							VOTE/COPE, and its lobbying group, the Committee of 100, are also included. Topics cover closing the academic achievement gap, credit recovery (attempts to allow students who missed class to make up course credit online, in order to
							graduate), charter schools, vocational training and other programs for non-college-bound students, and the state response to federal programs under presidents G. W. Bush and Obama, No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top,

						</unittitle>
						<abstract>Covers the period 1976-1994. The NYS Special Task Force on Equity and Excellence in Education (also known as the Rubin Commission or Rubin Task Force, named for its chairman, Max J. Rubin) was created to make recommendations
							for a state aid formula that would more fairly fund school districts, taking into account the great disparities in local wealth throughout the state. Materials in this collection focus mostly on the NYSUT committee that tracked the
							task force's work, the NYSUT Commission on Equitable Public School Funding. Meeting agendas and minutes, position papers, and correspondence comprise the bulk of the files, along with analyses of the 1978 NY Supreme Court decision
							(and the Appellate Division decision in 1981) in Levittown v. Nyquist, which found the current school aid formula unconstitutional. Files also include materials of the Task Force on Creating Career Pathways for New York State Youth,
							appointed by Governor Mario Cuomo in 1991 and co-chaired by NYSUT president Tom Hobart and Regent Walter Cooper of Rochester. The task force examined school-to-work transitions for students at risk of dropping out, including a
							proposal to replace the Regents general diploma with a Career Pathways Certificate at age 16 and establish alternative learning environments for students beyond the age of mandatory attendance. Finally, a large number of files
							reflect the work of the Curriculum and Assessment Council and its many subcommittees, which advised the State Education Department on its school restructuring initiative, A New Compact for Learning. Detailed critiques by NYSUT vice
							president Antonia Cortese, who was a member of the group, give insight into the level of concern by the teachers union for rigorous academic standards.</abstract>

							decisions, recruiting materials by the medical facilities, organizing materials by the unions, anti-union correspondence by management, salary and benefit information, financial filings, opinion surveys, and also materials dealing
