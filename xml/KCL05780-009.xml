         <p>Benjamin Schlesinger was born December 25, 1876, in Krakai, Lithuania,
		  in what was then Russia, the son of Nechemiah and Judith Schlesinger, and
		  attended the local Cheyder. His grandfather, Simcha, was Rabbi in Racinn,
		  Lithuania. His father died when he was four and his mother some years later in
		  1909. He emigrated with an older brother to this country in 1891, settling in
		  Chicago, and became an American citizen in that city on March 19, 1898. He was
		  married to Rose Schenhause on August 27, 1899 in Chicago. </p>
         <p>Schlesinger's first job after his arrival in Chicago was peddling
		  matches but, a few weeks later, he was employed as a "floor boy" in a cloak
		  shop. Two years later, when he was 17, and a sewing machine operator on ladies'
		  cloaks and suits, he led his first strike, a successful one, in his shop. He
		  was a delegate from Chicago to the convention, held at 125 Rivington Street,
		  New York City, which founded the International Cloak Makers Union of America on
		  May 1, 1892. Schlesinger, then only 16 years old, was elected treasurer. In
		  1895 he was elected recording secretary of the Chicago Cloak Makers Union, a
		  post he held for at least three years. He became business manager and organizer
		  of Local 5 of the Chicago Cloakmakers' Union in 1902 and, when the five Chicago
		  locals united under a Joint Executive Board, he became manager of that
		  organization. </p>
         <p>In May 1903, Schlesinger was elected president of the ILGWU and, after
		  only a brief term, became organizer for the New York locals in January 1904, in
		  which post he stayed until 1907. For the period 1907 to 1912, he served as
		  manager of the New York Jewish Daily Forward; while still in that position, he
		  served as a member of the Strike Committee in the 1910 strike and later was
		  appointed a member of the Board of Grievances (1911). </p>
         <p>In June 1914, Schlesinger was once more elected president of the ILGWU
		  and served until January 1923. During this period, other offices he held
		  included the following: manager of the New York Joint Board, "without pay,
		  temporarily," (1914); president, Needle Trades Workers Alliance (1920); member,
		  general executive board, International Clothing Workers' Federation, Amsterdam
		  (1919-23); delegate, American Federation of Labor, to British Trades Union
		  Congress (1922); and member, People's Relief Committee (1917-22). Schlesinger
		  served (1923-28) as manager of the Chicago office of the Jewish Daily Forward
		  and was elected, for the last time, as president of the ILGWU in October 1928,
		  serving until his death in June 1932. Benjamin Schlesinger was, at various
		  times, a member of the Workmen's Circle, Forward Association, Socialist Labor
		  Party and Socialist Party. </p>
         <p>Among the proposals which Benjamin Schlesinger initiated and which
		  were then or later adopted as policy by the Union, were the following: he
		  introduced at the convention of 1902 a resolution urging locals to arrange
		  bimonthly or at least monthly lectures and discussions on all educational
		  subjects. At the 1903 convention, he introduced a resolution urging locals to
		  establish sick-benefit funds. In 1914, he proposed special training of active
		  workers for the Union and the International entered into an arrangement with
		  the Rand School of Social Science for a course of studies for members of the
		  New York locals. The program lasted for one year. The following year, June 28,
		  1915, in the midst of demonstrations and strike demands on the question of
		  "hiring and firing," Schlesinger asked the Protective Association to submit the
		  dispute to a committee of unbiased persons. As a result a Council of
		  Conciliation was appointed by Mayor Mitchel and the strike was avoided. Another
		  strike in Chicago that same summer was similarly avoided. In 1918, he
		  successfully proposed that business agents be considered "experts" and
		  appointed by the elected officers. He was also successful, in the period
		  1920-21, in dividing Local 25 into two groups of waistmakers and dressmakers,
		  to accommodate the growing dressmaking section of the industry, resulting in
		  the establishment of the New York Dress Makers' Union, Local 22, then the
		  largest local union in the International. On July 1, 1920, Schlesinger
		  addressed a letter to the Neckwear Workers' Union of New York, the
		  International Journeymen Tailors' Union of America, the International Fur
		  Workers' Union, the United Garment Workers of America, the Amalgamated Clothing
		  Workers of America, and the United Cloth Hat, Cap Makers and Millinery Workers'
		  Union of America, proposing an alliance of all garment workers unions.
		  Discussions dragged on for several years but with only limited success. On
		  November 15, 1921, Schlesinger laid the cornerstone of a new building at 3 W.
		  16th Street, NYC, which served as the union's General Office until it moved
		  into 1710 Broadway in 1943. </p>
         <p>He was the author of several pamphlets on the garment industry. He
		  died on June 6, 1932. In 1967, the junior high school on New York Blvd.,
		  Jamaica, Queens, was named the Benjamin Schlesinger Junior High School in his
		  honor. </p>
