			<p>This unpublished monograph was prepared by George Novak in 1957-1958 for the Labor
				Project of the Fund for the Republic, directed by Paul Jacobs. The Fund for the
				Republic was a non-profit education corporation created by the Ford Foundation in
				1952 to counter pressures on civil liberties and basic freedoms from the political
				right. The Fund wanted to "support activities directed toward the elimination of
				restrictions on freedom of thought, inquiry and expression in the United States, and
				the development of policies and procedures best adapted to protect these rights."* </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The manuscript was written by George Novack, who had served the Consolidation
				Committee of Enginemen [CCE] as public relations advisor. The CCE was a powerful
				postwar nationwide caucus to affect the fusion of the Brotherhood of Locomotive
				Engineers [BLE] and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen
				[BLF&amp;E]. It functioned within the framework of the two unions to achieve
				amalgamation through constitutional procedures. Beginning in April 1946 under the
				leadership of Russell R. Walker, the CCE attempted to mobilize the rank and file of
				the two labor unions in support of unification. The merger plan was defeated in May,
				1949. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Mr. Novak's manuscript describes the development of the CCE, its approach to the
				issue of unification, and its strategies for organizing in support of a merger. The
				CCE did succeed in having its program adopted by the conventions of both the
				Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and
				Engineers. </p>
