            <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
                unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
                about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
                first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played a
                key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally
                referred to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope,
                membership size, and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces
                in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's
                garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its
                members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care
                facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The
                ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form
                the Union of Needle trades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged
                with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a
                new union known as UNITE HERE. The two unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented
                only 250,000 workers between them, down from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000
                in 1969.</p>

            <p>Unity House was a resort in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, operated by the
                International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union and used as a vacation destination and
                educational center for its members and their families. It was purchased by Locals 22
                and 25 in 1919, and consisted of a lake and 750 acres of land. In the 1920s the
                locals sold the resort to the international organization. Unity House prospered
                after World War II, but attendance dropped throughout the 1960s and continued to
                dwindle in the 1970s and 1980s. The ILGWU closed the resort in 1990. In 2000 it was
                purchased by a subgrantee of the Mountain Laurel Center for the Performing Arts.
                Unity House not only served as a vacation spot for ILGers and their families, but
                also as a meeting place for ILGWU officers and staff and other labor leaders. In
                this way, the resort was very much the outgrowth of Unity Houses and Unity Centers
                in New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia. In these cities, local unions
                established libraries, educational offerings, and recreational activities, hosted at
                local schools. With the establishment of the international's Educational Department
                in New York City that worked in cooperation with local union members, programs
                became increasingly robust. Such offerings that appealed to members' interests
                beyond the so-called "bread and butter" issues characterized the ILGWU's approach to
                organizing and building a union. Though Unity House in the Poconos was sold in 1989
                and closed a year later, the ILGWU's educational programs for members and their
                families continued in earnest until the union's merger with the Amalgamated Clothing
                and Textile Workers</p>
