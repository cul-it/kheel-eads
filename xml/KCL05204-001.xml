         <p>The Southern Tenant Farmers' Union (STFU), a biracial union of
		  sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and small landowners, came into existence in the
		  cotton plantation country of Arkansas in July, 1934, under the leadership of a
		  group of socialists, including H.L. Mitchell and Howard Kester. Although locals
		  were soon established in Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama,
		  the union's base of operation remained in Arkansas until 1945.</p>
         <p>Farm mechanization and the impact of World War II shifted the union's
		  focus from tenant farmers to migrant farm workers, whose numbers were rapidly
		  increasing. The union also began supplying temporary cannery workers during the
		  1940's.</p>
         <p>From 1937 to 1939, the STFU was affiliated with the CIO through the
		  United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing and Allied Workers of America (UCAPAWA).
		  After the STFU's withdrawal from the CIO in response to ideological differences
		  with the UCAPAWA, it remained independent until it secured direct affiliation
		  with the A.F. of L. in 1946. At that time, the organization's name changed to
		  the National Farm Labor Union (NFLU) and organizing efforts shifted to farm
		  workers in California. During the 1950's, the NFLU's successor, the National
		  Agricultural Workers' Union (NAWU), focused on organizing sugar, rice, and
		  strawberry workers in Louisiana.</p>
         <p>In 1960, the NAWU surrendered its AFL-CIO charter and merged with the
		  Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen. H.L. Mitchell, former secretary
		  of the SFTU, headed Local 300 of the Allied and Agricultural Workers' Union,
		  organizing rice mill workers and fishermen in Louisiana.</p>
