   <p>The Goodall Woolen Mills were founded in Sanford, Maine, by Thomas Goodall in 1867. Some of the plant's early production included railroad car upholstery, carpets, draperies, auto fabrics, and clothing fabric under the name "Palm Beach." The mills
    underwent a modernization phase in 1910. The Goodal family ran the company until it was sold to the Burlington Mills Corporation in 1953. In 1955 Burlington closed the mills.</p>
