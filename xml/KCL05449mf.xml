			<p>The Pullman Strike was a nationwide railroad strike and boycott that took place from
				May 11, 1894 to August 1894. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The Pullman Palace Car Company built railroad cars at its main factory just south of
				Chicago, Illinois, in the company town of Pullman. The majority of Pullman employees
				lived in the company town. As a company town, all housing, shops, churches,
				libraries, and other civic institutions were owned by the Pullman Company, which set
				the rates of rent, groceries, and other amenities. After the Panic of 1893 and the
				ensuing financial depression, the Pullman Company faced decreased demand for their
				product and in response slashed wages by about 25 percent while making no changes to
				the cost of living for their employees. The employees, fearing starvation,
				approached the owner of the company, George Pullman, to try to negotiate a solution.
				However, Mr. Pullman declined to make any changes or to engage in arbitration. In
				response, the Pullman employees walked off the job on May 11, 1894. Although only
				about 35 percent of the Pullman employees were represented by the American Railway
				Union [ARU] at the time of the walkout, the ARU and its president, Eugene V. Debs,
				promised to support the Pullman manufacturing workers in any action they took.
				Notably, the ARU did not extend the same courtesy to the African-American sleeping
				car porters employed by the Pullman Company. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>To support the Pullman employees who walked off the job, the ARU launched a
				nationwide boycott in which ARU members refused to run any train containing a
				Pullman car. By the end of June 1894, over 125,000 railroad workers on 29 different
				lines had walked off the job. The hope was that the railroad companies would force
				Pullman to compromise with his employees. Instead, the railroad companies
				coordinated their response, made sure that every train, passenger or freight, was
				pulling a Pullman car, and began hiring strikebreakers. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The ARU members on strike had agreed to continue to operate trains carrying U.S.
				mail, if there were no Pullman cars attached to the same train. The railroad
				companies' decision to add a Pullman car to every train meant that U.S. mail was not
				being delivered, and gave the federal government a pretext to intervene.
				Additionally, there was mounting public pressure to intervene as the strike and the
				boycott effectively crippled all railroads west of Chicago and rioting, vandalism,
				and looting became associated with the actions of the strikers. In early July,
				President Grover Cleveland sent troops to Chicago to break up the strike. At the
				same time, Eugene V. Debs was placed under injunction by circuit court judges,
				preventing him or other union leaders from communicating with their members. Debs,
				who had been urging restraint and decrying violence to his members, was suddenly
				unable to legally communicate with them and dissuade them from rash actions. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The arrival of the federal troops in Chicago on July 3, 1894 infuriated the strikers,
				and they and their sympathizers responded by destroying railroad property,
				overturning railcars, and creating barriers to block the troops from reaching the
				train yards. Violence exploded in the south side of Chicago, and at rail yards
				around the country, as the strikers and the federal troops clashed. Thirty strikers
				were killed, fifty-seven were wounded, over $80 million in property damage was
				caused, and the strikers had lost more than $1 million in wages. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Thanks to the intervention of the federal government, the strike was effectively
				broken by mid-July, and the Pullman employees returned to their jobs in August after
				agreeing to sign a pledge that they would never again try to join a union.</p>

			<p>Inclusive date range: 1894 </p>
			<p>Bulk dates: 1894 </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>This collection consists of the microfilm copy of a detailed report on the Pullman
				Strike of 1894. It includes an introductory analysis of Eugene V. Debs, George W.
				Howard, and a history of the American Railway Union. The report also recounts the
				history of the events preceding the strike and relates a day-by-day narrative of the
				strike. The report discusses officers and employees who were prominent in serving
				the company during the strike. Finally, the report offers a statistical analysis of
				the events, the strike's effect on business, and an essay discussing possible
				long-term consequences of the strike. This report was written on behalf of a
				railroad company, so there is a strong anti-labor bias throughout the report. </p>

				Topics on pp. vi-x. </p>
