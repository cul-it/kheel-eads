			<p>The Kansas City Southern Railway [KCS] is a Class 1 railroad operating in the United
				States and Mexico. The KCS was founded in 1887 in Kansas City, Missouri by Arthur E.
				Stilwell. The KCS expanded their holdings in the following decade through the
				acquisition of the Arkansas Western Railway Company and the Texarkana and Fort Smith
				Railway Company. The KCS successfully linked Kansas City with the Gulf of Mexico at
				its terminus in Port Arthur, Texas, which was named after Arthur Stilwell. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>KCS and its employees had been operating under series of contracts between the
				carrier and the various crafts and classes that had been in effect since 1924-1925.
				On January 1, 1932, both the carrier and the unions had entered, with 130 other
				American railroads and the unions, into what was called the "Chicago Agreement." The
				Chicago Agreement was a measure designed by President Roosevelt and his
				administration to help lift America out of the Great Depression in which the wage
				rates of employees would remain unchanged, but the railroads could deduct ten
				percent from each employee's pay check for a period of one year, provided the
				railroads did all in their power to maintain or even increase their number of
				employees. This wage reduction was part of a broader trend of wage reductions, in
				order to try and kickstart the American economy. At the end of this year, a wage
				dispute arrose between KCS and its employees. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, "An emergency board to investigate
				the wage dispute between the Kansas City Southern Railway and its engineers,
				firemen, conductors, and trainmen, was appointed on June 12, 1933. The carrier and
				these employees were parties to the so-called "Chicago agreement" of January 31,
				1932, which provided for a 10-percent deduction from the wages of the employees
				during the year beginning February 1, 1932. On December 31, 1932, the agreement was
				extended to October 31, 1933, on most of the railroads. The Kansas City Southern
				Railway Co. was not a party to the extension agreement, but continued to make the 10
				percent deduction under the terms of a mediation agreement entered into February 23,
				1933. On April 5, 1933, the carrier served notice of cancelation, on May 15, 1933,
				of all contracts covering rates of pay, rules, and working conditions. On April 6,
				1933, it declared its intention of placing in effect on May 16, 1933, new rates of
				pay, rules, and working conditions. Conferences and mediation were unsuccessful, and
				on June 6, 1933, the employees voted overwhelmingly to strike.</p> 
				<p></p>
				<p>On July 12, 1933, the
				emergency board reported its findings, pointing out the employees' belief that
				acceptance of the company's demands would mean 'a complete breakdown of the many
				years of efforts of organized railroad labor and would be and become an opening
				wedge toward the ultimate breakdown of these conditions upon all the other railroads
				in this country.' In deference to the wish of President [Roosevelt] 'for peace
				between labor and employer while the country is trying to regain prosperity,'
				expressed in a letter to [the KCS] president, the carrier postponed putting into
				effect the proposed new schedule until early in 1934, continuing in the meantime
				under the existing rates of pay, rules, and working conditions" (Handbook of Labor
				Statistics, 1936 Edition, Issue 616, pp. 22-23). </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1934, the same issues arose between KCS and their employees. President Roosevelt
				dispatch Joseph B. Eastman, Federal Coordinator of Transportation, to mediate
				between the parties. The strike was once again postponed while the parties submitted
				themselves to mediation.</p>

			<head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
			<p>Inclusive date range: 1921-1932 </p>
			<p>Bulk dates: 1932-1934 </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>This collection contains documentation of a wage dispute between the Kansas City
				Southern Railways [KCS] and their employees represented by the "Big Four" railroad
				brotherhoods: the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers [BLE]; the Brotherhood of
				Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen [BLF&amp;E]; the Order of Railway Conductors
				[ORC]; and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen [BRT]. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The records in this collection document the wages of employees who were members of
				one of the Big Four as well as how those wages would be affected by a proposed
				change to wage schedules by KCS management. Reactions to these changes from the
				union representatives, employees, and various managers are found in both
				correspondence and in pamphlets printed by both sides of the dispute to try to
				influence public opinion. The wage schedules are heavily annotated to show how the
				wages for the employees would fall should the KCS plan be put in place. Newspaper
				clippings documenting the negotiations are found in this collection. Of interest are
				the minutes of the meetings of the unions where the vast majority of the employees
				voted in favor of a strike and the correspondence between the grand chairmen of the
				Big Four, wherein they establish a series of code words to be used to verify the
				authenticity of any correspondence regarding a strike. Telegrams calling off the
				strike because of the intervention of the federal government are also found in the
				collection.</p>
