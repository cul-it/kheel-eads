            <p>Harrison Miller Trice (May 25, 1920 December 5, 1994) </p>
            <p>Harrison Miller Trice was Professor Emeritus in the Department of Organizational
                Behavior at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, Cornell University, where
                he had been a member of the faculty since 1955. Professor Trice's major contribution
                to his discipline has been the integration of the study of alcohol and drugs with
                the study of the workplace. More than any other social scientist, he was responsible
                for integrating occupational and organizational sociology with the study of alcohol
                and drugs. </p>
            <p>His courses on occupational culture, deviance in the workplace, and employee
                assistance programs were always popular. Until his retirement, he conducted a large
                course in which each student was required to carry out a specific field study. Among
                the most popular of these studies were those concerned with alcohol and drugs. While
                committed to research and public policy, Harrison Trice was also committed to
                teaching. </p>
            <p>Prior to his retirement from teaching in 1991, Professor Trice also played the
                pivotal role in securing an endowment to establish Cornell's R. Brinkley Smithers
                Institute for Alcohol-Related Workplace Studies at the School of Industrial and
                Labor Relations. After his retirement, he kept up an active research program,
                completing two books in 1993 on organizational culture-The Cultures of Work
                Organizations, co-authored with Professor Janice Beyer, and Occupational Subcultures
                in the Workplace. Both books have received great acclaim from reviewers. At the time
                of his death, he and Professor Paul Roman were revising Spirits and Demons at Work:
                Alcohol and Drugs on the Job, and he was co-editing with Professor Paul Steele a
                special issue of the Journal of Drug Issues on workplace programs for the prevention
                and treatment of alcohol and other drug problems. </p>
            <p>In 1994, Professor Trice was the recipient of two awards which recognized his
                lifetime contributions to the field of alcohol and drug studies. In August, he
                received the Distinguished Career Award from the American Sociological Association's
                Drinking and Drugs Section. In November, he received an award from New York State's
                Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services for his many contributions to the
                area of employee assistance programs, particularly his efforts to deliver rigorous
                training and education programs to practitioners.</p>
