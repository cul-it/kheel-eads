            <head id="a5" altrender="organizational history">ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY </head>
            <p>During the summer of 1905, Local Six of the International Typographical Union of New
                York City decided that they would demand an eight hour day when negotiating
                contracts for the following year. The Typothetae, an association of some 56
                publishing houses,notified the union in early November that they would not sign a
                new contract when the old one expired on December 31, 1905. Meanwhile the union
                negotiated contracts with some 281 publishing houses employing approximately 7,000
                of the union's 8,000 members which included an eight hour day. On January 2, 1906,
                no new agreement having been signed, the members of Local Six ceased to work for the
                Typothetae. </p>
            <p>On February 28, 1906 the Typothetae appealed to the New York State Supreme Court for
                an injunction on the grounds that Local 6 members were using threats of intimidation
                and violence to persuade the non-union members of the Typothetae either to leave the
                job or join the union. The court issued an injunction on March 2 which restrained
                the union from using force but did not enjoin picketing. </p>
            <p>In April, counsel for the Association requested the court to cite certain officers
                and members of the union for contempt, because the acts the injunction restrained
                had not ceased. The court appointed a referee to take testimony and made
                recommendations. The referee found that a great many of the allegations of threats
                and intimidation were supported by the facts, and that some of the men were not
                aware that this was precisely what the injunction enjoined. The referee held that
                Patrick McCormick and the other officiers were responsible for explaining the
                meaning of the injunction to the membership. A mere reading of the injunction at a
                meeting attended by only 1,000 of the union's members did not discharge this
                responsibility and they were, therefore, guilty of contempt for violating the
                injunction. </p>
            <p>The court fined the officers of the union $250 each and sentenced them to 20 days in
                jail. It also fined two members $100 each. This was the first time that officers of
                a union were held responsible for the acts of members of that union. The union
                appealed the decision to the New York State Appelate Court.</p>
