                HISTORY</head>
            <p>The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, the most significant union representing
                workers in the men's clothing industry, was founded in New York City in 1914 as a
                breakaway movement from the United Garment Workers. Radical and immigrant workers in
                the tailors' and cutters' locals were the core of the seceding group, which
                advocated industrial unionism and economic strikes in opposition to the UGW's craft
                organization, which they saw as conservative and timid. Their diverging views had
                come to the fore during the historic 1910 dispute at the Chicago firm Hart,
                Schaffner, and Marx. The opposition called the strike against the UGW leadership's
                advice, and reached a path-breaking agreement with management that established an
                arbitration system to settle disputes. </p>
            <p>Members flocked to the new union. Around 50,000 strong at its founding, by 1920 the
                ACWA counted about 170,000 members. Initially composed mostly of immigrants of
                Jewish European descent with Socialist leanings, the ACWA quickly welcomed members
                of a great number of nationalities and diverse backgrounds. Like in other garment
                unions, most workers and many members were women, but the leadership was
                predominantly male, a situation that did not change for many decades. Early on the
                union adopted a centralized administrative structure combined with industrial
                unionism, with the joint boards' by-laws having precedence over those of locals. </p>
            <p>Espousing a philosophy perhaps brought over by its early immigrant socialist members,
                the Amalgamated went beyond bread and butter issues and adopted a distinctive form
                of social unionism that was largely absent in the American labor movement. Starting
                in the 1920s, it provided educational opportunities and recreational facilities for
                its members, as well as services such as an insurance plan, banks offering personal
                loans at low interest rates, low-cost housing cooperatives, medical clinics, and
                even union-owned restaurants. </p>
            <p>Sidney Hillman was the first president of the new union and the most important
                officer in its history. He applied his experience as bargaining representative in
                Chicago to the whole industry. Under his leadership the union made significant
                strides in securing better wages and working conditions for its members, and at the
                same time it consolidated gains and provided stability to the industry through the
                widespread adoption of the arbitration system tested at Hart, Schaffner, and Marx.
                Hillman paid close attention to industry issues, such as production, pricing, and
                marketing. In order to help management meet the competition of non-union firms, the
                union conducted studies of efficiency, work methods, and factory costs. Letters to
                the official publication of the union, Advance, document the controversy that ensued
                within the union over what was perceived to be collaboration with management. </p>
            <p>Hillman also understood the importance of labor's involvement in national affairs and
                political action. In the 1920s the ACWA sent delegates to the Conference for
                Progressive Political Action and to the Farmer-labor party conventions. Although
                many members and officers were Socialists, the union stopped short of officially
                endorsing the party. Communist attempts at gaining influence within the union were
                firmly curbed. Hillman's participation in national affairs and politics became
                prominent during the New Deal, when he became a close advisor to Franklin D.
                Roosevelt on labor and economic issues. He also served on the board of the National
                Recovery Administration. Later, during World War II, he helped establish the Labor's
                Non Partisan League. He was also named associate director of the Office of
                Production Management, which assisted in mobilizing the nation's resources for the
                war effort. Hillman's prestige perhaps reflected the healthy condition of his union,
                which by the end of the conflict was strong and stable. </p>
            <p>During the post World War II period the union faced a number of significant
                challenges. Membership continued to grow (peaking at 395,000 in 1968), but the
                union's political influence and visibility in national affairs declined. In their
                never ending pursuit of lower production costs, many firms relocated to the South,
                forcing the union to engage in large organizing efforts. Simultaneously, signs began
                to appear of changes that would lead to the almost complete demise of the domestic
                apparel industry and, ultimately, to the erosion of union membership. Foreign
                imports of cheap clothing goods steadily grew in the 1950s and 1960s, and mushroomed
                in the following two decades, plunging employment in the apparel sector into a
                steady decline. Union efforts to stem the tide included Buy American campaigns and
                extensive lobbying in Congress, but they were to no avail. In 1976, the ACWA merged
                with the Textile Workers of America to become the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile
                Workers Union. Despite successful and much publicized nationwide actions such as the
                Farah boycott and the J.P. Stevens corporate campaign, the woes threatening the
                union's existence continued unabated. The fate of the domestic industry was sealed
                in the late 1970s and the 1980s by the flight of firms chasing tax breaks and cheap
                labor abroad. By 1995, when ACTWU voted to merge with the International Ladies'
                Garment Workers' Union, their combined membership was 350,000. The new Union of
                Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE!) seemed poised to infuse new
                life in a troubled union.</p>
