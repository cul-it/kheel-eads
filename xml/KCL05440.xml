            <p>Labor historian and professor of labor economics, whose research included the history
                of the Industrial Workers of the World, the first major American industrial and
                syndicalist union. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Brissenden (Ph.D. Columbia University) served as a special investigator for the US
                Bureau of Labor Statistics (1915-1920), taught labor economics and history at New
                York University (1920-1921) and at Columbia University, where he remained until his
                retirement. In addition to a number of publications in labor economics, Professor
                Brissenden wrote two major histories of the Industrial Workers of the World.</p>

            <p>Established in Chicago, 1905, by sponsors of socialism and the remnants of radical
                labor unions, including the Knights of Labor, Western Federation of Miners and the
                American Labor Union, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) or "Wobblies",
                evolved into a radical industrial union which waged campaigns for improved working
                conditions, wages and hours of work, as well as workers' control in mines, mills,
                lumber camps and factories.</p>

            <head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
            <p>Consists chiefly of incoming letters, newspaper and journal articles and clippings,
                documents, and notes of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) from its founding
                in 1905 to 1928. The bulk of the information derived from these sources was used by
                Brissenden in researching a book he was at the time engaged in writing (eventually
                published as THE IWW; A STUDY OF AMERICAN SYNDICALISM). General topics covered by
                the collection include the membership of the IWW; the structure of the union,
                particularly with reference to locals; theories of syndicalism and "direct action";
                free speech fights in varoius cities; and the criminal syndicalism and sabotage acts
                passed by various states in tye years 1917-1919. Also included are numerous drafts
                of portions of the book. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Specifically, the collection includes letters to Brissenden from Archie Robertson,
                IWW organizer, criticizing the title of Brissenden's book and taking exception to
                Brissenden's description of the IWW as syndicalist (1922); E. Pfister (Socialist
                Labor Party) requesting copies of Brissenden's book to be used in an unnamed trial
                (1922); Vincent St. John giving estimates, by year, of IWW membership, number of
                local charters granted, number of locals disbanding, and distribution of membership
                by industry (1915); Sidney Osborne (Arizona secretary of state) informing Brissenden
                that a state sabotage law had been vetoed by Governer Lister (1918); and William D.
                Haywood from Moscow, Russia, answering in detail Brissenden's queries about the
                history of the Western Federation of Miners and giving locations of documents
                relating to that organization (1923). Also, letter of William D. Haywood to C.
                McCarty (US Commission on Industrial Relations) regarding free speech fights in
                Kansas City, Kans., Los Angeles, Calif., Aberdeen, S.D., Denver, Colo., and Minot,
                N.D. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Also included in the collection are numerous copies of anti-syndicalist and
                anti-sabotage legislation from various states. Included, as well, are numerous
                newspaper and article clippings on anti-syndicalist legislation. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>In addition, collection includes copies of IWW convention proceedings and
                constitutions; essays by Brissenden on a variety of topics, including amnesty for
                IWW members convicted under anti-syndicalism laws, the IWW attitude toward the
                state, and the development of syndicalism in the IWW after 1909; and notes on many
                aspects of the development of the IWW and American radicalism, including comments on
                the formation of the United Harbor and Marine Workers of America, on the splits and
                differences among the left-wing parties in America, on Elizabeth Gurley Flynn's
                attitude toward William Haywood's leaving for Russia (1921), on the attitude of the
                IWW toward Soviet Russia (specifically the Red Traade Union International, 1921), on
                strikes conducted by the IWW, and syndicalism in Germany, France, and Italy. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Finally, copies of a notice served on behalf of the Durst Brothers to the County
                Boards of Directors of Yuma, Sutter, and Placer counties, declaring an imminent
                threat to property in those counties as a result of a proposed strike by IWW
                agricultural workers (1914); a copy of demands made by strikers at the Stone and
                Webster Construction Company in Big Creek (1913); and a questionnaire on conditions
                in logging camps (n.d.), among other documents. </p>
