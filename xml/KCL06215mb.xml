			<p>Neil P. Speirs was born in Alberta, Canada, on December 25, 1912 and moved to the
				United States with his parents in 1919. He became a naturalized citizen in 1942. Mr.
				Speirs graduated from the University of Idaho in 1934, having majored in business
				and education. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Mr. Speirs began his railroad career with Southern Pacific Railroad, working in the
				railroad's train yards. He was first elected to the local Grievance Committee of
				Adjustment for the Switchmen's Union of North America [SUNA], Local 98 (San
				Francisco, CA) in 1950. In 1952, he was elected as a full-time officer, serving as
				chairman of the General Grievance Committee of Adjustment, Southern Pacific Railroad
				[SP]. Mr. Speirs served in this capacity until 1955, when he was elected to serve as
				SUNA International Vice-President. In 1959, he was elected to be President of SUNA
				and served as President until January 1, 1969. </p>
			<p> </p>
			
			<p>On January 1, 1969 SUNA, along with the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen, the
				Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, and the Brotherhood of Railroad
				Trainmen formed the United Transportation Union [UTU]. Upon the merger, Mr. Speirs
				became Assistant President of UTU. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1969, President Richard Nixon appointed Mr. Speirs as the Labor Member of the
				Railroad Retirement Board. In 1974, President Gerald Ford re-appointed him to that
				position. He retired from the Railroad Retirement Board in 1977, but served on the
				Arbitration Panel of the National Mediation Board on a part-time basis until
				1978.</p>

			<p>This collection contains memoribilia collected by Neil P. Speirs over the course of
				his career. Numerous pins, both pin-back buttons and enameled stick pins, from SUNA
				are located in this collection. These pins either mark important milestones of
				Speirs' membership in SUNA or publicize SUNA initiatives and camapigns. Other SUNA
				memoribilia found in this collection include a commemorative plate and a zippered
				vinyl pouch. Because of his position as the president of SUNA and as assisstant
				president of UTU, Mr. Speirs also collected numerous guest badges and medals for the
				conventions of other unions. Also found in this collection are three enamel pins
				from the National Railway Workers' Union of Japan [NRU], given to Mr. Speirs during
				a visit NRU members made to SUNA headquarters in Buffalo, NY. A medal commemorating
				the founding of the UTU, with a portrait of Mr. Speirs on the front, is found in
				this collection. Finally, a pen used by President Lyndon B. Johnson to sign an act
				to facilitate research into high-speed ground transportation.</p>
