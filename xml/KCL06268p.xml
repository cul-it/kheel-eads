			<p>The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen [BRT] was founded in 1883 in Oneonta, N.Y. 
				as a protective and insurance organization.  The BRT was established to represent 
				members' interests in obtaining a satisfactory contract with management. The rail 
				service members of the BRT included conductors and their assistants, dining car 
				stewards, ticket collectors, train baggagemen, brakemen, and train flagmen. The 
				yard service members of the BRT included yardmasters, yard conductors, switchtenders, 
				foremen, flagmen, brakemen, switchmen, car tenders, operators, hump riders, and 
				car operators. By the time of its merger with three other railroad labor unions 
				to form the United Transportation Union in 1969, it had the greatest membership 
				of any of the operating railroad brotherhoods. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>
				The Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen [ORC&amp;B] was founded in 1868 to 
				represent the interests of railroad conductor. The first name of the organization 
				was the Conductors Union. The name was changed to Order of Railway Conductors of 
				America [ORC] in 1878. In 1942, the Order of Sleeping Car Conductors merged with 
				ORC. The union's name was changed in 1954 to the Order of Railway Conductors and 
				Brakemen to reflect the changes in their membership after the union began to 
				represent brakemen. In 1969, the Order merged with the Brotherhood of Locomotive 
				Firemen and Enginemen, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and Switchmen's Union of 
				North America to form the United Transportation Union. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The Rock Island Railroad (formally known as the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific
				Railroad) was a Class I railroad which operated in the midwestern region of the
				United States from 1852-1980.</p>
