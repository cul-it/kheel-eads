            <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
                unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
                about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
                first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played a
                key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally
                referred to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope,
                membership size, and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces
                in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's
                garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its
                members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care
                facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The
                ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form
                the Union of Needle trades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged
                with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a
                new union known as UNITE HERE. The two unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented
                only 250,000 workers between them, down from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000
                in 1969.</p>

        <bioghist encodinganalog="MARC 545">
            <p>Local 89 of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) was chartered in
                1919 and based in New York City. The local represented the Italian Dressmakers of
                the city. The dress industry formed its own Joint Board in 1921 composed of Local 22
                Dressmakers, Local 25 Waistmakers, Local 58 Waist Buttonhole Makers, Local 60 Waist
                and Dress Pressers, Local 66 Bonnaz Embroidery Workers, Local 89 Italian Waist and
                Dressmakers, and the waist and dress branch of Cutters' Local 10. A general work
                stoppage in February 1923 in the dress industry won the union a 40 hour week and 10
                percent wage increase, as well as a large gain of new members. Soon, the Dress and
                Waist Joint Board became unnecessary and was dissolved. Local 89, the Italian Dress
                and Waistmakers' Union, affiliated with the Cloak Board as well, and both dress and
                cloak industries in New York were represented by the Cloak and Dress Joint Board. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>By the end of 1926, the Communists had gained control of the dress organization in
                New York City and the union barely existed. In February 4, 1930, 25,000 dressmakers
                walked out of the shops. The strike was called to reorganize dressmakers and finally
                abolish the Communist influence in the industry. . On April 8, 1930 the General
                Executive Board decided to separate the dressmakers from the Cloakmakers' Joint
                Board and give them back an autonomous joint board to govern their own affairs. By
                February 1934, the Dress Joint Board moved to new larger offices along with Locals
                22 and 89, illustrating a drastic turnaround from previous years. The dress industry
                was now the biggest organized center in the ILGWU. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The decades of the 1960s and 70s saw a decline in shops and jobs in New York City
                with firms going out of business. By 1975, the New York Dress Joint Board completed
                restructuring of affiliate locals, and Locals 60-60A, 159, and 38 were merged into
                existing Locals 22 and 89. Local 22 gained jurisdiction over all dressmakers in
                Manhattan and Local 89 was designated the local for all Bronx and Brooklyn members.
                By 1977, Local 89 was the Coat, Suit, Dress, Rainwear and Allied Workers Union of
                South Brooklyn. In late 1981, the Joint Board approved a measure to dissolve locals
                and Local 89 was renamed Local 89-48 to honor the historic significance of the
                Italian cloakmakers.</p>

            <p>The collection consists of newspaper clippings, identified by publication and
                arranged by date. The earliest clippings are in Italian and are photocopies (no
                originals). Subjects covered include the dress industry, dressmakers, Luigi
                Antonini, Salvatore Ninfo and Local 89. Later clippings are contained in brittle
                scrapbooks that cover the Communist take-over of the dress industry and the fight
                within the union, Joint Board and dress locals. The scrapbooks document the
                activities of Local 89 between 1918 and 1944 and provide information on Italian
                Americans (especially in the garment industry), Italian affairs, and the
                Italian-American Labor Council.</p>
