   <p>New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) was created in 1972 by the merger of the New York State
    Teachers Association (NYSTA) and the United Teachers of New York (UTNY). NYSTA had been
    affiliated with the National Education Association (NEA), and UTNY with the American Federation
    of Teachers (AFT). UTNY was the statewide organization whose United Federation of Teachers
    (UFT), led by Albert Shanker, was the predominant teachers' union in New York City. In joining
    with United Teachers and affiliating with the AFT, NYSUT also became a member union of the
    AFL-CIO. </p>
   <p>In 1976, NYSUT voted to disaffiliate with the NEA. Some locals left NYSUT and created the NYEA
    (New York Educators Association), which became the state affiliate for the NEA. In the early
    1980s, NYEA changed its name to NEA-NY. </p>
   <p>NYEA/NEA- NY viewed association with the AFL-CIO's industrial unions as undermining the
    professional image and independence of teachers. The two organizations also differed strongly on
    aspects of the governance structure, particularly with respect to ethnic minority
    representation, with NYSUT opposed to mandatory minimums. The rivalry between NYSUT and
    NYEA/NEA-NY in organizing new locals expended a great deal of resources for both labor
    organizations. </p>
   <p>While competition with NYEA/NEA-NY was a constant focus of NYSUT's organizing efforts for
    teachers, NYSUT was also organizing college faculty members, nurses, and other non-teaching
    personnel. Once members were organized, NYSUT continued to advocate for teachers' and other
    workers' rights through contract support and legal services at the local level and political
    involvement at the state and federal levels, supporting candidates and legislation that
    protected funding, due process, and working conditions. </p>
   <p>NEA-N Y merged with NYSUT in 2006, by which time NYSUT had grown to more than half a million
    members, becoming the largest union in New York State.</p>

   <head id="a5" altrender="organizational history">ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY </head>
   <p>Thomas Y. Hobart, Jr., served as president of NYSUT since it was created in 1973 from the
    merger of NYSTA (New York State Teacher's Association, founded in 1845 and the largest state
    affiliate of the National Education Association) and UTNY (United Teachers of New York,
    affiliated with American Federation of Teachers-AFL-CIO). Hobart was a prime mover in the
    disaffiliation of NYSUT from the NEA, and reaffirmation of affiliation with the AFT, in 1976. He
    was involved in jurisdictional disputes that followed the split for many years, as NYSUT and NEA
    (through its affiliate, New York Educators Association) fought for membership at the local
    level; the rivalry was finally resolved when the two again merged in 2006, still maintaining
    strong ties with the AFT. </p>
   <p> The president serves as a vice president of the AFT and vice president of New York State
    AFL-CIO and represents NYSUT in high-level interactions with state elected and appointed
    officials, particularly the Department of Education; international labor organizations;
    political parties; nonprofit service organizations such as the New York Special Olympics; and
    other unions. The president or his assistant has often visited regional offices to maintain
    firsthand contact with local concerns. </p>
   <p>Hobart retired in 2005 and was succeeded by NYSUT's current president, Richard Ianuzzi.</p>
