            <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
                unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
                about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
                first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played a
                key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally
                referred to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope,
                membership size, and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces
                in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's
                garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its
                members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care
                facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The
                ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form
                the Union of Needle trades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged
                with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a
                new union known as UNITE HERE. The two unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented
                only 250,000 workers between them, down from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000
                in 1969.</p>

            <p>The Education Department of Local 22 was developed to further the educational and
                cultural development of the Local's membership. It routinely sponsored lectures and
                courses on a variety of labor and other topics; it also offered musical and dramatic
                performances on a regular basis, either for or featuring its membership. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Local 22 of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), also known as
                the Dressmakers' Union, was chartered in December 1920 and based in New York City.
                The dress industry formed its own Joint Board in 1921 composed of Local 22
                Dressmakers, Local 25 Waistmakers, Local 58 Waist Buttonhole Makers, Local 60 Waist
                and Dress Pressers, Local 66 Bonnaz Embroidery Workers, Local 89 Italian Waist and
                Dressmakers, and the waist and dress branch of Cutters' Local 10. A general work
                stoppage in February 1923 in the dress industry won the union a 40 hour week and 10
                percent wage increase, as well as a large gain of new members. During the summer of
                1923, after years of discussion and deliberation, the two dress locals, Local 23 and
                22 were consolidated. The dressmakers from Local 23 transferred to Local 22 and
                subsequently Local 22 joined the New York Cloakmakers' Joint Board. Soon, the Dress
                and Waist Joint Board became unnecessary and was dissolved. Local 25 Waistmakers
                were left without an affiliated organization and in October 1924 merged with the
                Dressmakers' Union, Local 22. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>By the end of 1926, the Communists had gained control of the dress organization in
                New York City and the union barely existed. In February 4, 1930, 25,000 dressmakers
                walked out of the shops. The strike was called to reorganize dressmakers and finally
                abolish the Communist influence in the industry. On April 8, 1930 the General
                Executive Board decided to separate the dressmakers from the Cloakmakers' Joint
                Board. In 1931, Charles Zimmerman formed a committee to rebuild Local 22. He was
                elected to executive board of Local 22 in 1932, and elected manager-secretary in
                1933. Another walkout in all dress shops, both union and non-union on August 16,
                1933 brought the dress industry to a halt. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Zimmerman left Local 22 in 1958 to become manager of the Dress Joint Board. Israel
                Breslow succeeded him as manager of Local 22 from 1958 until his retirement in 1975.
                By 1975, the New York Dress Joint Board completed restructuring of affiliate locals,
                and Locals 60-60A, 159, and 38 were merged into existing Locals 22 and 89. Local 22
                gained jurisdiction over all dressmakers in Manhattan. In the 1980s, more locals
                were dissolved and members transferred to Local 22, but by 1984, Local 22 saw
                restructuring as well. Changes in the garment industry necessitated the dissolution
                of the Joint Board and Local 22 into the new Local 89-22-1.</p>

            <p>The photographs in the collection were pulled from the records of the Local 22
                Education Department (5780/057). The images illustrate the wide range of activities
                and programming put on by the department. Photographs show members taking classes,
                especially the women members. Classes depicted include music and literature. There
                are also dinners and banquets, meetings and conferences, speakers and lecterns and
                rallies. Additionally, there are portraits of officers and members, many with
                Charles Zimmerman (see also 5780/014P).</p>
