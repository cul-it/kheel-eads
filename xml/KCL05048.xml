            <p>The Emergency Board, appointed by the President was composed of David L. Cole,
                chairman, Saul Wallen and Dudley E. Whiting, the same board, that was appointed to
                hold hearings for the Flight Engineers Case on Board #120. </p>
            <p>Hearings were begun in Miami, Florida on March 12, 1958 and later continued in New
                York City on April 3. The main issue involved was the question of crew complement on
                new aircraft. The pilots contended that the third crew member on certain types of
                aircraft should be a licensed pilot, not a flight engineer. Other issues involved
                were pension plans, wages, working hours and travel time.</p>
