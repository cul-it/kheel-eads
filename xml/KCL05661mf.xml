            <p>The Elmira Central Trades and Labor Assembly was organized in 1894 by 13 unions and
                was chartered by the American Federation of Labor in 1901. The member unions were:
                Plumbers; steam and gas fitters; bricklayers and masons; sheetmetal workers, metal
                polishers and buffers; cigar makers; machinists, carpenters, printers, molders,
                breweryworkers, barbers, tailors and bartenders. </p>
            <p>Early records of the Chemung County Historical Society show the first elected
                officers of Local 23, Bricklayers, Plasterers and Masons, in 1885 were: Daniel J.
                Lucy, president; John Crowley, vice president; Norman Friend, recording secretary;
                Michael Murray, financial secretary; Dennis Connelly, corresponding secretary, and
                John Connelly, treasurer. </p>
            <p>John E. Murphy was an early president of the Assembly, for many years located at 202
                East Water St. in what was known as Labor Hall. It moved to 322 Carroll St. in 1912.
                After the 1972 flood the Assembly occupied 559 East Church St. </p>
            <p>In 1957 the Chemung County AFL-CIO Assembly was formed by the AFL unions plus the
                United Auto Workers and the International Union of Electrical Workers of the CIO and
                District 58, International Association of Machinists. </p>
            <p>One of the old-time unions disappeared when the hand-made cigar business folded. The
                1901 charter of the Cigarmakers was turned in to Walter L. Wainwright, Assembly
                president, for safe keeping. </p>
            <p>The building trades led the fight for a five-day work week and an eight-hour day.
                Earlier it had been six days with nine to 10 hours a day. From before World War I to
                1930, it was eight hours Monday through Friday with four hours on Saturday. In the
                1930s the Saturday hours were eliminated. </p>
            <p>The unions led the negotiations for higher wage scales. In 1903 the Painters Union
                asked for $2.50 for an eight-hour day with 45 cents an hour for overtime while the
                Carpenters local asked $3 a day. The Plumbers Union achieved a $3 a day for eight
                hours in 1904. </p>
            <p>The Assembly often had trouble holding its tradesmen in line. A ruling in 1903
                allowing members to work on a job with non-union help led to Sheetmetal Workers
                withdrawing from the Assembly. Bricklayers and Masons, who were on strike, also
                withdrew. They were seeking a 45 cent hourly wage and an eight-hour day. </p>
            <p>H. Paul Shay was Labor Assembly president from 1939-1944. He was business agent of
                Local 289, Theatrical Employees Union, in the 1930s. Shay was a prominent Democrat
                and a candidate for mayor in 1942. He long was chairman of Draft Board 64 during and
                after World War II. </p>
            <p>Fritz J. Clark of the Communication Workers of America is current president. His
                predecessor was Clarence G. Doty, who served as president in 1961-69, succeeding
                Wainwright. </p>
            <p>Union labor made its greatest advances after World War II especially higher wages,
                fringe benefits and in some cases improved health standards on the job. Unions often
                went on strike to achieve these goals. </p>
            <p>The craft unions formed the Elmira Building Trades Council to police their membership
                and protect employers from unfair tactics. A business agent, elected by the
                membership, served as a liason between employers and the workers. </p>
            <p>The craft unions also had their own business agents. Well-known during this period
                were George Gerard, Charles Spencer and Fred Kohlberger, Earl F. Harris of the
                Sheetmetal Workers and Ralph Halloran of the Electrical Workers achieved responsible
                positions with national headquarters in Washington.</p>
