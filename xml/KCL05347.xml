			<p>The merger between the Erie Railroad Company and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western
				Railroad [DLW] was approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission [ICC] on September
				15, 1960. The DLW, its properties and franchises, were put under the complete
				control of the Erie Railroad Company, resulting in the creation of the
				Erie-Lakawanna Railroad Company [ELRR]. Both the Erie and the DLW had been losing
				revenue in the post-war period due to a decline in passenger and freight traffic,
				most notably the decline in use of anthracite coal which had been the mainstay of
				DLW's freight operations. This was compunded by the rise of the interstate highway
				system and the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, which provided direct access to
				the Great Lakes and further eroded their customer base. The Erie and DLW, long-time
				rivals and covering similar geographic areas, started to merge operations in 1956 in
				an attempt to make the company profitable. As a result of this merger, an estimated
				4,000 jobs would be abolished or transferred to other locations, resulting in
				hardship for both the affected employees as well as any employee of lesser seniority
				who would be displaced, or "bumped," by an employee with greater seniority. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In an attempt to protect their members, the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way
				Employees [BMWE] and the Railroad Labor Executives Association [RLEA], filed suit in
				U.S. District Court, seeking to halt the merger. The BMWE was the authorized
				collective bargaining representative for maintenace of way workers on both the Erie
				and the DLW; the RLEA, an association of 22 railroad union executives, filed as
				party-intervenor in the proceedings before the ICC. Their efforts ultimately proved
				fruitless, as the merger was allowed to proceed as planned, and the employees were
				compensated by the so-called "New Orleans conditions" as originally delineated by the
				ICC.</p>

			<p>This collection includes a brief filed with the United States District Court for the
				Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, involving the Brotherhood of
				Maintenance of Way Employees [BMWE] (plaintiff) and the Railway Labor Executives'
				Association [RLEA] (intervenors/plaintiffs) vs. the Interstate Commerce Commission
				[ICC] (defendant), and the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad Company [ELRR]
				(intervenors/defendants). The arguments concern the effect of a merger on the
				employees of the Erie Railroad and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad,
				and the union's request that the court uphold the 1940 Transportation Act
				guaranteeing four years of employment for all current employees. The brief, filed by
				the BMWE, includes the history of the merger that created the ELRR, arguments
				against the merger, a history of employee protection in the railraod industry, the
				history of the 1940 Transportation Act, and the application of the "New Orleans
				conditions," whereby employees adversely affected by the merger may be granted
				compensatory protection if their employeement is terminated rather than being
				guaranteed at their current level for a period not exceeding four years.
				The collection also includes the lifting of the injunction by the court, allowing
				the merger to be completed as per the original plan approved by the Interstate
				Commerce Commission, including the "New Orleans conditions" with regards to the
				railroad employees.</p>
