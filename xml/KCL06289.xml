			<p>The Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen [ORC] was founded in 1868 as an order of
				railroad conductors and later expanded to include brakemen. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen was founded in 1868 in Amboy, Illinois
				as the Conductors Union. Initially, it was a fraternal benefit society, but by 1890
				it had adopted a policy of engaging in labor negotiations on behalf of its members
				as well as permitting its members to strike. The name was changed to Order of Railway Conductors of America in 1878. In
				1942, the Order of Sleeping Car Conductors merged with ORC. The union's name was
				changed in 1954 to the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen to reflect its changing membership. The ORC
				International Headquarters, Grand Division, was located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa with
				subordinate divisions in the United States, Canada, and the Panama Canal Zone. In
				1969, the Order merged with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen,
				Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and Switchmen's Union of North America to form the
				United Transportation Union. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Local Division 642 was one of the subordinate divisions of the ORC. It was located in
				West Springfield, Massachusetts; its members were employees of the Boston and Albany
				Railroad. These employees were split into two divisions, the Boston Division and the
				Albany Division, each division working the 100-mile stretch from Springfield to
				either terminal point.</p>

			<p>This collection consists of a selection of records produced by ORC Local 642. The
				records are primarily concerned with dues, both owed and paid, and assessments of the
				Local and its members by the Grand Division in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Also present in
				this collection is correspondence between the Grand Division and Local 642, ORC
				circulars from their 40th Anniversary (1948), and remittance forms. Of note are the
				quarterly rosters listing the names of all members of Local 642 and, in the case of
				the roster produced by the Grand Division, local addresses of the union members. The
				rosters produced by the local division include the names of its members and they
				dues they had or had not paid.</p>
