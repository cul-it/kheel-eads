   <p>Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities in the
    northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size, political
    influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized labor by mid-century.
    Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and
    living conditions of its members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs,
    health care facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. In
    1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form
    the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE).</p>

   <head id="a4" altrender="biography">BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE </head>
   <p>Elias Lieberman had a long history and career with the ILGWU. Born on November 10, 1888, he
    came from Russia in 1909. He was the deputy clerk of Local 25 from 1913-1916 and the chief clerk
    from 1916-1917. Lieberman was the chairman of the union's Educational Committee in 1917, and
    from 1918-1920, he was with the publication department of the International. Afterwards, he
    became an attorney and counsel for the ILGWU until the 1960s. Lieberman was a member of the New
    York and Federal Bar, was counsel for not only the ILGWU, but also the United Hatters, Cap and
    Millinery Workers' International Union, the International Jewelry Workers' Union, Local 1, the
    United Furniture Workers of America, the International Ladies Handbag, Pocketbook and Novelty
    Workers' Union and other labor organizations. In addition, Lieberman wrote on many aspects of
    the law and labor including "The Collective Labor Agreement: How to Negotiate and Draft the
    Contract" (1939) and "Unions Befor the Bar: Historic Trials Showing the Evolution of Labor
    Rights in the United States" (1950). Lieberman died in October 1969.</p>

   <head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
   <p>The collection contains the unpublished manuscripts of Elias Lieberman. As a lawyer,
    Lieberman's manuscripts often involve legal matters, including trials, testimonies and
    transcripts. But with Lieberman's lengthy involvement with the ILGWU, the historical accounts
    are not merely reports of proceedings, but personal eye witness narratives that provide
    additional insight into the union and garment industry. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>"The Changing Images of American Trade Unionism: A Threat to Labor and a Challenge to the
    Statesmen of Labor," at twenty seven typed pages, discusses the varying view of organized labor
    and labor leaders with sections entitled "The Image of the Helpless Worker," "The Image of the
    Union as the Underdog," "The Image of the Rightless," "The Image of Idealism," "The Image of
    Protection," "The Threat to Labor," "The Challenge," "Guilt by Classification," "A Moral Force
    of Labor," and "Will the Challenge be Met." </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>"A Portrait of Seventh Avenue: Events and Human-Interest Stories of, by, and about the Garment
    Center in New York City" is comprised of stories about the people and historic events of 7th
    Avenue, focusing on human interest accounts about the manufacturers, contractors and workers.
    Also included is information on the garment industry and its progress in labor- management
    relations, including the establishment of industry "courts" to settle disputes between unions
    and employers. The manuscript focuses on those "courts" and the stories that arose from
    firsthand knowledge and personal interviews, and while based on fact, the author took the
    liberty to polish facts and change names. The short stories often center around a particular
    individual or event, sometimes recounted through a crime, arbitration or court trial. Lieberman
    presents pressers, contractors, shop owners, machine operators, all having personal stories that
    paint a broad picture of the garment industry. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>"The Mysterious Disappearance of Juliet or A Lady Communist Vanishes (A True Story)," focuses
    on the disappearance of Mrs. Julia S. Glaser, also known as Miss Juliet Stuart Poyntz. Lieberman
    had been representing Poyntz in Surrogate's Court in connection with her late husband's estate.
    Poyntz first became involved with the garment industry and the union when she was hired as the
    first educational director of the Dressmakers' Union (at the behest of Morris Hillquit), in
    which she developed a program for adult labor education, set up lecture series by professors,
    and organized dancing and recreation classes. She also launched some of the early cooperative
    housing initiatives for the young and unmarried immigrant girls of the union, and the concept of
    "unity houses" soon expanded into vacation retreats, whose popularity led to the union's
    purchase of the Unity House summer resort in the Poconos. After much success instituting
    programs, Poyntz was offered the position of Education Director of the ILGWU. Lieberman's
    history with Poyntz dates back to her time with the ILGWU as he headed the union's Committee on
    Education which provided the approval for her educational plans and programs. She was last seen
    on June 5, 1937 and missing for four months before a friend of Poyntz informed Lieberman that
    the American Woman's Club, where she had been staying, contacted her to inquire about the unpaid
    rent. Lieberman initially performed a private investigation before contacting police. Poyntz was
    active in the Communist Party and became the head of the Women's Department of the CPUSA. She
    also worked for the Soviet Secret Police. From his personal knowledge of Poyntz and involvement
    in the case, Lieberman discusses Poyntz's history, the circumstances surrounding her
    disappearance, and the many theories that circulated regarding her vanishing. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The unbound manuscript pages for "A Portrait of a Leader: A True Labor Story of a Man and an
    Era" tells the story of Morris Sigman, president of the ILGWU from 1923-1928. The account begins
    with the death of Herman Liebowitz in July 1910. Liebowitz, a strikebreaker during the Great
    Revolt of 1910, was found beaten to death on a New York sidewalk. Four years later, Morris
    Sigman, Morris Stupnicker, and Solomon Metz were arrested for his murder. After being released
    on bail, the case was continually adjourned month after month until on May 11, 1915, Sigman,
    Stupnicker, and Metz were rearrested along with Julius Woolf, Abraham Weidiger, Max D. Singer,
    Isidore Asphitz and Louis Holzer, and charged with the murder of Liebowitz. In September, the
    charges against Holzer were dismissed, and the "Trial of the Seven Cloakmakers" began September
    23, 1915 in New York Supreme Court with Assistant ADA Lucien S. Breckinridge and DA Charles A.
    Perkins, and Morris Hillquit who served as the defense attorney. The trial ended in a not guilty
    verdict and the manuscript provides an eyewitness account of the events, even providing word for
    word accounts of the court room, including opening statements, witness questioning and
    testimony, and closing arguments. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The manuscript also offers a complete account on the history of the ILGWU, including such
    events as the Uprising of 20,000 (1909), the Great Revolt (1910) and the internal struggle
    within the union and with Dr. Hourwich. But mainly the pages focus on the life of Sigman and his
    tenure with the union. Detailed is Sigman's early history, including coming to New York and
    finding work as a presser, his early involvement with the Socialist Labor Party and the IWW, his
    work to form an independent union of cloak pressers, and his eventual involvement with the
    ILGWU. Sigman quickly moved up the ranks of the ILGWU holding various positions until his
    election in 1914 as general secretary-treasurer. Also interspersed is background information on
    Benjamin Schlesinger, David Dubinsky, and Charles Zimmerman. Particular attention is paid to the
    tempestuous nature of Sigman's presidency, the behind the scenes internal struggle among the
    Communists and the union, as well as the internal struggle that ultimately unseated Sigman.
    During his time as president, an opposition faction existed within the union that sought to
    change the election of officers to a memorandum vote of the membership after the convention
    instead of the current practice of election through the majority of present delegates at the
    convention. Such a change would require a change in the union's constitution. The referendum was
    rejected and Sigman re-elected president in 1925 while Schlesinger (who was the opposition's
    choice for the presidency) became a new vice president. As internal tensions continued, Sigman
    resigned due to differences in principle for the welfare of the union at the general executive
    board meeting in October 1928. Upon his resignation, Schlesinger became the president of the
    union for the third time. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The manuscript continues with Sigman's retirement and home life with his wife at their
    amusement park in Iowa, his health and illnesses, his return to New York to find employment as a
    presser, and his sudden death on July 19, 1931 from a heart attack. Lieberman intimately
    documents the life and legacy of Morris Sigman.</p>
