   <p>Terence Vincent Powderly was born in Carbondale, Penn. In 1849. A machinist by trade, Powderly
    became active in union organizing, eventually becoming the chief executive officer of the Order
    of the Knights of Labor, a post he held from 1879 to 1893. He was also active in politics and
    served three terms as mayor of Scranton, Penn. (1878-1884). After resigning as General Master
    Workman of the Knights, Powderly was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1894 and re-entered
    political life </p>
   <p> while practicing law. He served in several important posts in the Bureau of Immigration
    (1898-1921) as well as as commissioner of conciliation with the Department of Labor, a post he
    held from 1921 until his death in 1924. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Terence Vincent Powderly, the son of Terence and Madge Walsh Powderly, both Irish immigrants,
    was born on January 23, 1849, in Carbondale, Pennsylvania. Life among sven brothers and four
    sisters was spartan, and young Powderly had little opportunity to obtain much more than a
    rudimentary education. At age thirteen, Powderly took his first job as switchman for the
    Delaware and Hudson Railroad. He had decided on a career as a machinist, and in August, 1866, he
    was apprenticed for three years to master machinist, James Dickson. At the end of his
    apprenticeship in August, 1869, Powderly found employment in the machine shops of the
    Pennsylvania Coal Company. He was later employed in the machine shops of the Delaware,
    Lackawanna and Western Railroad Company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>At the time Powderly joined the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad the Long Strike was
    in progress among the anthracite coal miners in Pennsylvania. Powderly's experiences during the
    Long Strike and the mine explosions at Avondale, Pennsylvania, in September, 1869, proved to be
    important influences in his life. Determined to do what he could to relieve the plight of his
    fellow workers, he joined the International Union of Machinists and Blacksmiths in 1971. He
    later became president of his local chapter. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>In 1873, the United States experienced a severe economic depression. This depression, coupled
    with Powderly's union activities, led to his dismissal. During the winter of 1873-1874, Powderly
    traveled through several Midwestern states and Canada in search of work. He finally found a job
    in Galion, Ohio, only to be fired because his name appeared on a blacklist of union agitators.
    Powderly frequently experienced blacklisting during the 1870s. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>In 1876, while working in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Powderly was admitted to Scranton Local
    Assembly No. 88 of the Order of the Knights of Labor. Soon he had organized an assembly of the
    machinists and became its Master Workman. Powderly advanced rapidly in power and influence in
    the Knights of Labor. In 1877, he was elected corresponding secretary of District Assembly No.
    5. He was elected Grand Worthy Foreman in January, 1879, and in September was elected to the top
    post of Grand (later General) Master Workman, a post to which he was re-elected annually until
    he resigned in 1893. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>While steadily rising in the ranks of the Knights of Labor, Powderly became involved in
    Scranton politics. In 1876, he became president of the Greenback-Labor Club. From 1878-1884, he
    served three terms as Scranton's mayor. During his incumbency as mayor Powderly worked to make
    Scranton a progressive city. He established a board of health for the city and worked for
    legislation against adulterated foods, to obtain a meat inspector, and for funds to construct a
    municipal sewage system. In 1880, he signed into law a bill which made Scranton's tax structure
    more equitable. Powderly's three terms as mayor also saw improvement in such areas as municipal
    improvements and an open city administration. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>When Powderly left the mayor's official in 1884, he was able, for the first time, to devote
    all his energies to the administration of the Knights of Labor. He realized that the Order was
    in the midst of a divisive internal struggle. The trade unionist faction within the Order
    believed that higher wages and better working conditions could best be achieved by the strike
    and boycott. Powderly and his supporters believed that the strike should be used as a last
    resort, only after the Order had tried to educate and convince management to accept its
    position. The abortive Southwest Strike of 1886 caused greater division within the union and
    resentment against Powderly, who had called off the strike. The rival American Federation of
    Labor, under Samuel Gompers, took advantage of the Knights' internal disorders and successfully
    interested dissatisfied Knights to join. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The discontent within the Order continued to grow. A group of Order leaders, including General
    Secretary-Treasurer John William Hayes, formed the so-called Home Club, which worked for
    Powderly's removal from office. In 1893, Hayes and others charged Powderly with misuse of the
    Order's funds. During the November General Assembly meeting Powderly was exonerated and
    subsequently re-elected General Master Workman. Facing a hostile executive board, however,
    Powderly resigned in 1893. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>As General Master Workman, Powderly's policies were based on the preservation of the American
    worker's control of his job situation. He believed in the integration of blacks into the social
    and economic life of the nation, as well as the Order. He felt such participation would be in th
    ewhite laboring man's best interest. He also felt that women should be paid the same as men for
    the same work and should have equal opportunity for employment advancement. He fought for the
    eight-hour workday and the abolition of the wage system. He supported Chinese exclusion and
    protective tariff legislation. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>After resigning as General Master Workman in 1893, Powderly studied law. He was admitted to
    the Pennsylvania bar in 1894 and later admitted to practice before the Supreme Courts of
    Pennsylvania and the United States. While practicing law, Powderly re-entered political life. In
    1894 he became a member of the Central Republican Club of Scranton. During the presidential
    campaign of 1896, Powderly was asked to campaign for William McKinley. After McKinley's
    inauguration in 1897, Powderly applied for appointment as Commissioner-General of Immigration.
    Soon after his appointment to this post in March, 1898, Powderly established a commission to
    investigate conditions at Ellis Island. As a result of this investigation, eleven employees were
    dismissed. When Theodore Roosevelt became president, Powderly's rivals attacked him and finally
    succeeded in obtaining his removal from office. After an investigation he was reinstated by
    President Roosevelt in 1906 as Special Immigration Inspector. Roosevelt sent him to Europe to
    study the causes of European immigration to the United States. As a result of this trip Powderly
    prepared a report in which he advocated that the Immigration Service, through its agents in
    Europe, should select prospective immigrants while they still resided in their home country;
    that agents of the serviced should be on ships carrying immigrants; and that once here,
    immigrants should be more evenly distributed throughout the nation. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>In 1907, Powderly was appointed chief of the Division of Information of the Bureau of
    Immigration, a post he held until 1921 when he was appointed a member of the bureau's Board of
    Review. From 1921 until his death on June 24, 1924, Powderly also served as a Commissioner of
    Conciliation with the Department of Labor. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>John William Hayes was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on December 26, 1854. Hayes
    remained in Philadelphia until about the age of seventeen. In 1871 he moved west to Illinois
    where he worked as a farm hand. Not long after he moved to Ohio where he was employed as a
    brakeman for the Dayton and Michigan Railroad. When the financial panic of 1871 struck, Hayes
    lost his job and returned to his family in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Hayes secured employments
    in 1872 as a brakeman with the Pennsylvania Railroad at Trenton, New Jersey, and later at
    Philadelphia. On May 28, 1878, he was involved in a serious railroad accident and lost his right
    arm. His next position was with the American Union Telegraph Company, where he remained until
    1883. He was fired because of his involvement in union activities. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>In August, 1874, while employed by the Pennsylvania Railroad, Hayes was initiated into
    District Assembly 49 of the Knights of Labor. Soon after joining the Order, Uriah S. Stephens
    gave Hayes an organizer's commission. In 1884, the General Assembly elected Hayes a member of
    the General Executive Board, and in 1886, he was elected secretary of the board. In November,
    1888, the General Assembly elected Hayes General Secretary-Treasurer of the Knights of Labor. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Hayes's labor philosophy amplified the Knights' motto that perfect government was that "in
    which an injury to one is the concern of all." Only by implementing this principle could the
    disinherited laboring masses be free. As with Powderly, Hayes considered strikes as ineffective.
    He supported the principles of cooperation and education. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The General Assembly elected Hayes General Master Workman of the Knights of Labor in 1902.
    While undertaking these duties, Hayes was involved in other activities. He was manager of the
    Atlantic Gas Construction Company in Philadelphia and had invented a coal gasification device.
    After the First World War, Hayes urged labor organizations to abjure any connections they might
    have with the "Red Menace." Hayes also had interests in stocks and lands. He was president of
    the North Chesapeake Beach Land and Improvement Company until his death in 1942.</p>

   <p>The Knights of Labor constituted the most powerful force in American labor in the nineteenth
    century. It was the first national labor organization to recruit extensively and as a matter of
    policy both women and blacks, to organize throughout the country, and to attempt to unify
    industrial and agrarian workers. Between 1869 and 1896 the Order spanned the United States with
    fifteen thousand Local Assemblies.</p>

    the Black Diamond Anthracite Coal Company, and personal and family matters. </p>
   <p>The bulk of the materials on the Knights of Labor (Series A) consists of correspondence
    (1864-1924), both incoming and outgoing. The most valuable portion of this correspondence covers
    the period during which Powderly served as General Master Workman (1879-1893). The letters
    reflect the growth of the Order and its position on such issues as education, the eight-hour
    workday, the use of the strike, trade unionism and blacklisting. The difficulties and power
    struggles which disrupted the Order are also evidenced. Also included in this series are
    constitutions of Local and District Assemblies as well as the General Assembly (1878-1890);
    business records consisting of two volumes of minutes of Local Assembly 222 of Scranton, Penn.
    (1876-1880) and expense accounts of Powderly as General Master Workman (1888-1892); proceedings,
    including seven proceedings for Local Assemblies (1883-1890), ninety-one proceedings for
    District Assemblies (1877-1890) and twenty proceedings for State Assemblies (1885-1894), as well
    as an incomplete set of proceedings for the General Assembly (1878-1902); and printed matter,
    consisting of the JOURNAL OF UNITED LABOR, vol.1 - vol.4 no.1 (1880-1883), ritual books,
    clippings scrapbooks, notes for speeches and writings, and printed leaflets, brochures, and form
    letters issued by the Knights (1886-1895). </p>

    commissioner-general of immigration, as chief of the Information Division of the Bureau of
    Immigration, and as commissioner of conciliation for the Department of Labor. Filed with the
    correspondence is Powderly's 1906 report on emigration to the United States, the result of an
    investigation ordered by President Theodore Roosevelt. Also included in this series are
    miscellaneous and legal files dealing with the deportation of immigrants as contract laborers;
    warrants for deportation; court cases relating to the Alien Contract Law; Memoranda, statistics
    and reports of the Immigration Bureau; reports on Chinese and Japanese immigration; and a
    transcript of the Luigi Graziano Case (1900) dealing with corruption in the Bureau of
    Immigration. Pamphlets on immigration (1883-1903) include reports of the commissioner-general. </p>
   <p>Series C contains correspondence, reports and circulars relating to the Black Diamond
    Anthracite Coal Company of Schuylkill County, Penn. Powderly served as president of the company
    from its founding in 1902 until 1905, when he resigned, suspecting a swindle. </p>
   <p>Personal papers (Series D) include correspondence (1896-1937) between Powderly and his friends
    and family, as well as with organizations to which he belonged. Powderly's 1896 campaign
    activities on behalf of William McKinley are documented here. Also included are diaries

    clippings relating to Powderly, the Knights of Labor, and the Bureau of Immigration; Photographs
    (Series H) depict Powderly, his home and family, Knights of Labor staff and officials and other
    labor leaders, as well as views of the Immigration Bureau's facilities at Ellis Island.</p>
