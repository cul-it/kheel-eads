            <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
                unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
                about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
                first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played a
                key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally
                referred to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope,
                membership size, and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces
                in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's
                garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its
                members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care
                facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The
                ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form
                the Union of Needle trades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged
                with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a
                new union known as UNITE HERE. The two unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented
                only 250,000 workers between them, down from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000
                in 1969.</p>

            <head id="a5" altrender="organizational history">ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY </head>
            <p>Little documentation exists in the ILGWU records about the work of the Operations
                Department in the union's international offices, and the materials that comprise the
                Operations Department records do not explicitly show that they were created by the
                department per se. While typically an operations department is known to deal with
                the everyday business of an organization and to have responsibility for the
                organization's facilities, the records suggest that the department either
                complemented the work of the Research Department, the Master Agreements Department,
                and the former Management Engineering Department, or maintained records useful to
                those departments.</p>

            <head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
            <p>The Operations Department records consist of materials relating to the ILGWU's
                efforts to maintain a ban on industrial homework, manuals for operations standards
                in the manufacturing of women's blouses and women's skirts, and collective
                bargaining agreements. The records relating to homework and operations standards
                date from the 1980s, and the collective bargaining agreements are from the years
                just before the ILGWU merged with ACTWU in 1995. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Researchers interested in ILGWU statements on homework and related issues should
                consult the Research Department records, 5780/209. Likewise, researchers looking for
                additional collective bargaining agreements should consult collections in Series VI,
                Contracts and Case Files (5780/075, 5780/075 mf, 5780/145, 5780/146, 5780/147,
                5780/158, 5780/191). These records, and others throughout the ILGWU records,
                complement the records of the Operations Department. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>This collection consists of operations standards manuals for women's blouses for 1983
                and 1984, and women's skirts for 1984.</p>
