            <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
                unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
                about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
                first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played a
                key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally
                referred to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope,
                membership size, and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces
                in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's
                garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its
                members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care
                facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The
                ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form
                the Union of Needle trades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged
                with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a
                new union known as UNITE HERE. The two unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented
                only 250,000 workers between them, down from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000
                in 1969.</p>

            <p>Charles Sasha Zimmerman was born in Russia in 1897. He arrived in the United States
                in 1913 and soon found work in garment shops. His career with the ILGWU began in
                1916 when he went to work in a waist shop and joined Local 25. By 1925, Zimmerman
                was a member of the Executive Board for Dressmakers' Local 22. Throughout the 1920s,
                Zimmerman was an active member of the Communist Party, an affiliation that cost him
                his leadership positions within the union in 1925. He was involved with the bitter
                Communist infighting, and though he initially belonged to the Communist Party, he
                soon saw that they subverted the strike of 1926 for its own purposes which nearly
                decimated the ILGWU. With other members now opposed to Communism, Zimmerman worked
                to rid the Communist influence from the union and help reorganize the dress industry
                with his reinstatement in 1931. Even after his reinstatement in the ILGWU, he
                maintained close ties with the anti-Stalinist Lovestonites of the Communist Party. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Zimmerman was elected manager of Local 22 in 1933, and the next year became a vice
                president of the ILGWU. He became general manager of the New York Dress Joint Board
                and the Dressmakers' Joint Council in 1958. Zimmerman was involved with civil
                rights, social welfare and international labor organizations throughout his career.
                He was a trustee of the National Urban League, chairman of the Jewish Labor
                Committee's National Trade Union Council for Human Rights, and a member of New York
                City's first Human Rights Commission. Zimmerman helped found the Inter-American
                Federation of Textile and Garment Workers in 1966 and served as a U.S.
                representative to the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers Federation.
                In 1969, Zimmerman was elected president of the Jewish Labor Committee and named to
                the Civil Rights and Social Security committees of the AFL-CIO. He resigned as a
                union vice president and general manager of the Dress Joint Council and New York
                Dress Joint Board in 1972. Zimmerman died in 1983.</p>

            <p>The Charles Zimmerman papers consist primarily of correspondence, reports, minutes,
                newspaper clippings, and broadsides dealing with his activities as a leader in Local
                22 (in Series I), as well as his other union and political activities (in Series
                II). b Among the most significant material in the collection is correspondence
                documenting Zimmerman's activities with the Communist Party in the U.S. and its
                various factions and splinter groups, as well as other political organizations and
                figures. Correspondents include Jay Lovestone and William Z. Foster; there is also
                considerable material dealing with the Communist Party of the U.S.A. and the
                "Majority Group," or Lovestone faction. Other political parties represented include
                the American Labor Party, the Liberal Party (New York State), and the Socialist
                Party. </p>

            <p>The remainder of the materials covers union affairs, both within and outside of the
                ILGWU, from the 1920s to the 1950s, as well as labor issues in general. There is a
                good deal of information on civil rights and African-American employees from the
                1930s to the 1950s. Other subjects include anti-fascism and anti-Nazism; strikes and
                other labor disputes in the U.S. and Canada; union elections; and worker education. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Significant organizations represented in the Zimmerman collection include the AFL and
                CIO (before and after the merger); the Fur and Leather Workers' Union; the Jewish
                Labor Committee; joint boards and locals of the ILGWU, especially Local 22 in New
                York; the League for Industrial Democracy; the NAACP; the National Urban League; the
                Workmen's Circle; and the Works Progress Administration. </p>
