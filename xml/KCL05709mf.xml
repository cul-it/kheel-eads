            <p>As the League's president from 1907 to 1922, Margaret Dreier Robins, the well-to-do
                daughter of a Brooklyn businessman, guided it through the period of its most active
                work. Among her close associates were several working class women who served as
                officers of the national or local Leagues, including Leonora O'Reilly of New York
                and Agnes Nestor and Mary Anderson of Chicago. After 1922, working women took over
                the leadership; Rose Schneiderman, a veteran leader of strikes in the needle trades,
                served as national president from 1926 to 1950.</p>

        <bioghist encodinganalog="MARC 545">
            
            <p>The Women's Trade Union League was founded in 1903 during the annual convention of
                the American Federation of Labor. Local branches were organized within a year in
                Boston, Chicago and New York. In 1907 its name became the National Women's Trade
                Union League of America. The League sought to counter the exploitation of working
                women by organizing them into trade unions and by securing protective legislation
                regulating their hours and working conditions and setting minimum wage standards.
                Its dual membership of working and middle class women made the League unique among
                social reform organizations of its day.</p>
        </bioghist>
        <scopecontent encodinganalog="MARC 520">
            
            <p>The records of the National Women's Trade Union League of America (NWTUL) span the
                lifetime of the organization from the first meeting in Boston in 1903 to the last
                bulletin of its official organ, LIFE AND LABOR, announcing the termination of the
                League's national charter in 1950. The records consist of correspondence, memoranda,
                speeches, clippings, notes, printed matter, and miscellaneous other items. </p>
            <p>The NWTUL's administrative operations are well documented in the headquarters
                records. Its policies and activities are recorded in the minutes of the Executive
                Board meetings and in the correspondence. Most of the letters and memoranda are from
                the various national League secretaries, particularly Elisabeth Christman, who held
                the position from 1921 to 1950. There is, as well, correspondence from various
                members of both the national and local Leagues, especially from the New York,
                Boston, and Chicago branches. Many of the local League members also served as
                officers and/or Executive Board members of the national League and are represented
                in the headquarters records. Included in this group are Margaret Dreier Robins, Mary
                Morton Kehew, Jane Addams, Rose Schneiderman, Mary Kenney O'Sullivan, Melinda Scott,
                Agnes Nestor, and Mary E. Dreier. Interspersed with the materials documenting the
                activities of the League are financial statements enumerating sources of income and
                costs of operation. </p>
            <p>The subject files as well as the headquarters records offer a major source of
                information concerning the League's goal of organizing women wage workers into trade
                unions. There is considerable material on the early history of the League in the
                historical data file. Many of the files on individual members contain biographical
                information, and the file on the American Federation of Labor sheds light on the
                League's relationship to that organization. Here and in the headquarters records is
                correspondence with Samuel Gompers, Frank Morrison, Frank Duffy, and Florence C.
                Thorne. </p>
            <p>Both series (headquarters records and subject files) contain documentation of the
                League's efforts to improve women's working conditions through supporting strikes,
                particularly in the garment industry, through the use of a training school to
                develop leadership among women of the working class, and through lobbying for the
                enactment of protective labor legislation. Issues such as the eight-hour day, a
                minimum wage, and the establishment of sanitary work areas were the focus of the
                League's early days. However, its interests broadened in later years to include
                federal aid to education, civil rights, price control, and social security.
                Correspondents include Ethel M. Smith, Eleanor Roosevelt, Sophonisba P.
                Breckinridge, Mary Anderson, Alice Henry, and Frances Perkins. </p>
            <p>The records of the NWTUL also contain proceedings for 10 of the 13 national
                conventions and mimeographed corrected copies of the proceedings of the three
                international congresses which the League sponsored.</p>
