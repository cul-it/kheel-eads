   <p>The American Association for Labor Legislation was formed to promote uniformity of labor legislation and to encourage the study of labor conditions with a view toward promoting desirable legislation. </p>
   <p>The Association was founded as a branch of the International Association for Labor Legislation. Preliminary discussions about forming the group occurred during 1905 and culminated in the first meeting of the Association held on February 15, 1906, in New
    York City. </p>
   <p>During the Association's first few years, three basic objectives were established: to serve as the American branch of the International Association for Labor Legislation; to promote uniformity of labor legislation in the United States; and to encourage
    the study of labor conditions with a view toward promoting desirable labor legislation. </p>
   <p>John Bertram Andrews was appointed executive secretary in 1909. His wife, Irene Osgood Andrews, eventually became associate secretary. John Andrews, as lobbyist, lecturer, author and editor of the publication THE AMERICAN LABOR LEGISLATION REVIEW, became
    the motivating force of the Association. Broadly speaking, the American Association for Labor Legislation set the following goals: the alleviation of adverse working conditions; the creation of laws to protect safety and health on the job; and the
    provision of compensation in times of unemployment and benefits for workers no longer able to participate in the labor force. To facilitate the implementation of the Association's interests, study groups were established to investigate labor conditions.
    Active lobbying was undertaken in support of protective labor legislation in state and federal legislatures, and critiques were published concerning pending bills. The lifetime of the Association roughly corresponded to Andrew's lifetime; its activities
    ceased after his death in 1943.</p>

     <p>This early correspondence relates almost entirely to the formation and early administration of the American Association for Labor Legisla-tion (AALL). Much of the initiative for its inauguration was taken by Adna F. Weber and Henry W. Farnam, whose
      interest in the International Association for Labor Legislation (IALL) inspired the establishment of its American counterpart. A circular and an invitation to attend the general meeting to organize the American section of the IALL on Feb. 15, 1906, drew
      favorable response from several persons who would later be influential in the Association, notably Samuel Gompers and Miles Mehander Dawson. The formal founding of the AALL dates from that 1906 meeting, and subsequent correspondence deals with the
      leadership and personnel problems of the infant association, as well as with the relationship of the new organization to the IALL. Richard T. Ely, first president of the AALL, wrote to Weber (2/26/07) commenting that the AALL needed a paid representative
      to give his full time to the work. The perennial problem of fund raising became a theme early in the organization's correspondence. During 1908, the course that the AALL was to follow for the next few years was developed. John R. Commons, then secretary,
      wrote to Dr. Henry B. Favill of the American Medical Association expressing a desire to meet with him and Dr. Alice Hamilton to discuss the investigation of occupational health and disease (1/21/08). This dialogue accelerated the development of a
      standard nomenclature for occupational disease and a proposal to investigate and recommend standards for industrial hygiene. Newly appointed Assistant Secretary Irene Osgood exchanged letters with Margaret D. Robins. Their correspondence concerned the
      Association's desire to investigate industrial diseases and poisons, and the plans for establishment of state chapters. Support for the organization was sought and won from socially conscious national leaders, including Louis Brandeis, Edward T. Devine,
      Samuel Gompers, and Alice Hamilton. The assistance of reform-minded groups such as the National Child Labor Committee was also successfully solicited. Early in 1909, Commons and Osgood suggested to Henry W. Farnam that John Andrews would make an
      excellent executive secretary. There was some question at this juncture as to whether the official stationery of the Association should carry the union label. Arguments on this issue went on for several years and are symptomatic of the organization's
      ambivalent attitude toward organized labor. Dr. Alice Hamilton continued her work with the AALL on industrial poisons and her letter to Osgood (2/13/09) suggested that a study of the match industry be undertaken because of its widespread use of poisonous
      white phosphorous.</p>

     <p>The investigation into phosphorous poisoning continued and developed into the "Phossy Jaw" study. Interest arose in the Association in workmen's compensation and the Illinois 10-Hour Law, and John Andrews became the paid executive of the organization
      at about this time. Louis Brandeis wrote to Arthur Kellogg (5/26/09) about the pension bill of the Boston and Maine Railroad. The letter is significant for its early discussion of certain provisions which eventually were adopted into the American old age
      pension system. Correspondence during this period relates: to changes in legislation in regard to job hazards, insurance, employment office regulations, and child labor. The organization cooperated extensively with Brandeis and Josephine Goldmark in the
      preparation of material with which to fight defeat of the Illinois 10-Hour Law. Louis Brandeis expressed his gratitude to Andrews (11/30/09) for the information Andrews gathered for Brandeis' work on the 10-Hour case brief. John R. Commons wrote Henry W.
      Farnam (12/25/09), suggesting that the Association would do better to concern itself with active lobbying for measures it supported rather than with organizing. Since the state branches of the Association were not proving satisfactory. Commons thought
      that they should be discontinued. Early in 1910 the executive office was transferred to New York City where it remained for the life of the Association. In February John Andrews began to collect information on a contributory workmen's compensation
      insurance plan; and the Association continued to refine this plan for the next thirty years.</p>

      Women's Trade Union League, child labor and hours of labor for women. Congressman John Each, sponsor of the match bill, wrote often in regard to various provisions and problems of the bill. At the end of January a resolution was passed, authorizing the

     <p>The emergence of sickness insurance (health insurance) as a major concern of the AALL dominates this period. Joseph Chamberlain outlined a suggested survey of European sickness insurance (1/7/14) to be made prior to the AALL's investigation of the
      situation in the United States. Many meetings of the Association's sickness insurance committee were held. I. M. Rubinow wrote often in reference to drafting a standard bill (a prototype legislative bill on a specific issue) on sickness insurance. There
      was some controversy over whether or not it should be compulsory, and P. Tecumseh Shermam resigned because of the disagreement (1/9/14). An interesting letter (9/16/13) to Henry Seager and Henry W. Farnam describes Andrews' visit to the Cripple Creek
      Mine, the mine owner's blacklist, a meeting with "Mother" Jones, and the growing conservatism of the Western Federation of Miners. Irene Osgood Andrews wrote the report on minimum wage legislation in New York State. In December (12/24/13) Andrews wrote
      again to Gompers, asking for an apology. Andrews became interested in another problem of working conditions and wrote often to Thomas J. Parkinson of the Columbia University Legislative Drafting Department and others in regard to revision of the
      compressed air provisions of the New York State labor laws.</p>

      to certain sections of the bill and frequently wrote to Andrews about it. Throughout January and February, plans were made for the National Conference on Unemployment that was to be held in New York City (2/27/28). In addition, the growing problem of
      unemployment sparked many surveys and reports. The meetings of the Sickness Insurance Committee continued. Andrews defended the AALL's impartiality on "unionism" to James Emery (2/26/14) and disclaimed any interest in labor-management disputes beyond the
      questions of health and safety. Mid-March saw John and Irene Andrews working together on a survey of free employment bureaus, and for the passage of a free employment agency bill in the New York State Legislature. In June, Andrews began to prepare for
      the European Congresses of the IALL by writing reports on United States labor legislation, unemployment, social insurance and industrial disease.</p>

     <p>The commencement of World War I affected the Association drastically, The IALL congresses were cancelled and funds that had been available to further the work of the AALL were diverted to war relief. But sickness insurance and unemployment were still
      major issues. Frederick Hoffman, who had been active on the Sickness Insurance Committee of the AALL reported himself upset over the principle of compulsory insurance. Katherine Coman suggested (8/13/14) that the committee stress prevention as well as
      relief, a change that was soon made. Many requests for help in drafting workmen's compensation laws were received from all over the United States during this period. Andrews was busy on a study of occupational anthrax in the United States. In the fall, a
      study of the effect of lead poisoning on workers was begun, using the Brooklyn Bridge painters as a test group. Walter Lippmann interviewed Andrews on the unemployment problem in October for a special issue of the New Republic. John R. Commons and
      Andrews consulted frequently on their book, Principles of Labor Legislation.</p>

     <p>Andrews continued to work daily on health insurance. Most of the correspondence deals with this bill. At the end of May, Samuel Gompers resigned as Associate Vice President. There is commentary on this event from several people, including an undated
      letter (circa June) from Milton Fairchild to Henry Seager, in which he reports that: "Gompers says he has changed the name of the Association to the Ameri-can Association for the Assassination of Labor Legislation." John Andrews' letter to James Maurer
      (7/12/15) is an excellent example of the strategy employed by the Association in exploiting emo-tions to explain the need for their legislation. This letter deals with the death of two "sand hogs" who were buried alive in an accident that "...could not
      have occurred if our bill for the protection of compressed air workers had been in force in Pennsylvania." On August 9, a series of letters and a questionnaire on relief of unemployment through public work was sent out. Replies were received for the next
      several months.</p>

     <p> John Andrews sent Samuel McCune Lindsay the tentative program for 1916 (1/7/16), providing an excellent synopsis of the year's work. The program on social insurance was to stress workmen's compensation, health insurance and unemployment insurance.
      Accident and disease reporting, support for the federal bill for a Museum of Safety, and the urging of passage of the standard bill for compressed air workers and a cleanliness bill for lead workers were to dominate the industrial safety and hygiene
      phase of the Association's work. To meet the abuses of the so-called continuous industries, a one-day-rest-in-seven bill was advocated, as was the three-shift system. Finally, the Association was to urge reorganization of state labor bureaus, especially
      in Kentucky, Maryland, and New Jersey, as a means of making the administration of existent labor legislation more effective. The health insurance standard bill was introduced in Albany and Boston. John Randolph Haynes approached Andrews (1/29/16) and
      volunteered a substantial contribution if the AALL would make coal mine safety the first priority of its program. Through May, Royal Meeker, Middleton Beaman, and others worked with the Association in urging passage of the Kern-McGillicuddy Bill
      (workmen's compensation for District of Columbia). In April, Andrews testified before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Labor in favor of the establishment of a Commission for Investigating Social Insurance. Frederick Hoffman
      resigned from the Association in a letter to Irving Fisher, in protest against the AALL's insistence upon compulsory health insurance.</p>

     <p>Intensive lobbying for health insurance continued as Andrews con-ducted a campaign to raise funds for its promotion with the slogan, "Health First." The Association supported legislative bills for health insurance in New York and Michigan. On the
      federal level, the AALL's most important piece of legislation was the Kern-McGillicuddy Bill. In May, John Andrews sent AALL staffer Irene Sylvester to Washington to act as the Association's lobbyist. Her informal letters to the New York office,
      reporting on the progress of the bill, give examples of how one congressman put pressure on another to insure his vote. In June, when she complained of discouragement, Andrews wrote to her, "Cheer Up! Morbid depression is an occupational disease among
      those who are obliged to be pleasant to Congressmen." (6/5/17) In late August, Andrews was able to inform the AALL members that the bill had passed the Senate and that "...we can now concentrate even greater effort on our campaign for universal health
      insurance." Paul H. Douglas advised Andrews that since war seemed inevitable, the Association should adopt a policy of guarding against exploitation of workers in time of war (4/1/17) .. John Andrews initiated a special series of bulletins, Labor Laws in
      War Time. Communication with the IALL offices in Europe became virtually impossible.</p>

     <p>Under the pressure of the war effort, demands for health insurance were de-emphasized, while problems created by the emergency came to the fore. The United States Department of Labor War Policies Board sent Andrews policy memoranda for review in late
      August. In December of 1916, Andrews advised Senator Joseph Robinson (12/6/17) that the legislation providing for federal public employment offices which he was to introduce should be pushed as a war emergency measure. This is referred to as the
      Robinson-Keating Bill in later letters., Gompers, largely out of touch with the Association, telegraphed an invitation to Andrews to attend the American Federation of Labor Employment Problems Conference. A form letter to members (12/19/17) outlined the
      program for 1918, which included war emergency measures, Federal Public Employment Ser-vice, health insurance, and labor adjustment. In mid-January 1918, Charles Barnes, Irving Fisher, Royal Meeker, V. Everitt Macy and Edward Keating all wrote to
      Andrews, urging him to take the lead in the fight for the Robinson- Keating Bill. Irene Osgood Andrews became very much involved in efforts to organize the Maternity Center in New York City. Many state federations of labor wrote for advice on health
      insurance, and in the fall, the AALL worked for workmen's compensation in Maine, Arkansas and North Dakota.</p>

      insurance, and a minimum wage for women. In early January, Henry Sterling sent a copy of the workmen's compensation act which he had prepared for the American Federation of Labor to Andrews for his criticism. Letters were received from IALL staff members
      Sophy Sanger and Stephen Bauer, trying to re-establish communications. Frances Perkins, Commissioner of the New York State Industrial Commission, wrote to ask for information on maternity insurance, and later wrote to Irene Andrews for John's views on
      health insurance. Irene Sylvester, now Mrs. Walston Chubb, was sent by the Associa-tion to Albany to lobby for the Donahue-Davenport health insurance bill. In March 1919, a new standard bill for workmen's compensation was issued , based on that of the
      state of Ohio and on federal legis-lation. Irene Andrews wrote Sophy Sanger (4/2/19) that she expected to be in London in April to tour maternity centers, and that John would be in London later that summer.</p>

      "I think that my profession will get over its present state of hysteria (over health insurance) just as my ancestors got over the Salem witchcraft." The federal employee retirement bill, known as the Sterling-Lehblach Bill, was energetically promoted

      (Sterling-Lehblach) was passed in late May. Many people wrote to congratulate Andrews on the Association's role in securing its passage. Unemployment insurance was again an issue, and Andrews suggested to J. J. Handley (9/24/20) that the Wisconsin State
      Federation of Labor try to sponsor an unemployment insurance bill in its state.</p>

     <p>Workmen's compensation for seamen, longshoremen, and private employees in the District of Columbia continued to provide an important activity for the Association. Joseph Chamberlain and Miles Dawson worked together closely on the longshoremen's bill,
      and the Association cooperated with Congressman Roy G. Fitzgerald on the bill to provide workmen's compensation for private employees in the District. On several occasions John Andrews lobbied in Washington for support of the Fitzgerald Bill. John
      Randolph Haynes again approached the organization, offering funds if the AALL would work on coal mine safety. John Andrews replied (5/31/21) that "$1000 will mean a vigorous campaign for mine safety that fall." In September, Herbert Hoover invited
      Andrews to attend conferences on unemployment in Washington, and Andrews was active for some time as a member of the Economic Advisory Committee of the United States Department of Commerce.</p>

     <p>Federal bills for workmen's compensation for longshoremen and for workers in the District of Columbia continued to receive most of the Association's attention, along with efforts to secure the adoption by individual states of an exclusive state fund
      for workmen's compensation. The Association was opposed to discrimination against the non-resident dependents of aliens in allotting compensation. Many advocates of the Kenyon Bill for long-range planning of public works sought Andrews' support. The
      blanket equality amendment of the National Women's Party and coal mine safety also received attention in the early months of 1922.</p>

     <p>The Fitzgerald Bill, the child labor amendment, and coal mine safety were of primary importance to the AALL throughout the spring of 1922. Irene Andrews continued to be involved with the Maternity Center and with bills for maternity protection. A
      five-page, handwritten letter from Felix Frankfurter to Andrews (5/29/22) questions whether there should be any federal labor legislation at all, and discusses the child labor amendment and the practice of "constitution tinkering" in general.</p>

     <p>Irene Sylvester Chubb was sent again to Washington to lobby for the Fitzgerald bill for workmen's compensation. John Andrews worked closely with Gifford Pinchot, newly elected Governor of Pennsylvania, on many issues relative to labor law
      administration. Abraham Epstein wrote that he had become associated with the Eagles fraternal organization and would be working with Frank Hering on old age pensions (9/11/22). Louis Varlez (9/21/22) and Stephen Bauer (12/9/22) wrote that the IALL missed
      the cooperation of the American branch, and urged Andrews to work for unification of all the international organizations interested in social progress. The program for 1923 emphasized a living wage, unemployment relief, mine accident prevention, and
      workmen's compensation.</p>

     <p>In addition to the programs planned for 1923, a heavy emphasis on old age pensions and insurance dominated the work of the Association. Columbia University Legislative Drafting Bureau sent John Andrews (1/12/23) the program of the AALL for old age
      pensions that had been worked out in cooperation with the Eagles. Abraham Epstein wrote often during the early months of the year on the progress of the old age pension bill and Gomper's attitude toward it. Epstein's personal dissatisfaction with his job
      is evidenced in his April correspondence. Felix Frankfurter wrote to Andrews (6/18/23) in regard to his def-inition of law enforcement. Herbert Hoover wrote in late August to invite Andrews to serve as an informal observer at the International
      Unemployment Association Conference in Luxembourg that fall. Sidney Hillman explained the workings of his union's private unem-ployment insurance contract (9/26/23). During the summer months, special efforts were made to fight discrimination in granting
      workmen's compensation awards to the non-resident dependents of aliens.</p>

      frequently about her activities. Correspondence was carried on with the American Mining Congress and the Mining Safety Coordinating Committee. H. Foster Bain, Stephen Wise, E. A. Holbrook and William Green communicated on the coal mine safety program and
      urged Andrews to continue this campaign. In April, Alice Hamilton wrote concerning new problems of phosphorous poisoning in fireworks plants in New Jersey.</p>

     <p>The Association continued to be concerned about industrial disease and accidents, particularly those relating to radium poisoning and mine safety. Katherine Wiley wrote Andrews about several girls who died after being employed to paint radium on watch
      faces, and enclosed several letters which gave details of the case (6/19/24). Andrews suggested to Ethelbert Steward (6/19/24) that the Bureau of Labor Statistics should investigate the problem of phosphorous poison in the fireworks industry and the
      radium poison cases. Correspondence with E. A. Holbrook, the American Mining Congress and the Mining Standardization Coordinating Committee continued to emphasize coal dusting and general mine safety. Henri Fuss wrote about the merger of the IALL and
      other international associations with the International Association for Social Progress (IASP) (7/10/24). Andrews asked Herbert Hoover if the government would be willing to pay his passage to the IASP Congress, but Hoover replied (9/8/24) that, although
      he would like Andrews to be the government's informal representative, there were no funds available to support this trip. Ida Tarbell wrote John Andrews in 1925 that she expected to write a piece on coal dusting: "This is not merely to save face with you
      but because I would like to do something, even if so very little, to help push the matter."</p>

     <p>The Epstein-Andrews split over Abraham Epstein's organization of a new national association advocating old age pensions began in December, 1925. Worth M. Tippy of the Federal Council of Churches requested John Andrews' assessment of Abraham Epstein and
      his ideas after Tippy was approached to back Epstein's new national organiza-tion. The program for 1926 was prepared in late November and included the fight for "real wages", reduction of waste in industry, workmen's compensation, accident prevention,
      and unemployment relief. The area of special interest in workmen's compensation during late 1925 and early 1926 was the passage of legislation to protect interstate workers, especially longshoremen and seamen. Anthony Chlopek of the longshoremen and
      Andrew Furuseth of the seamen were the Association's chief union contacts. Throughout January and February, several criticisms of the AALL's newest federal longshoremen's and interstate workers' compensation bill were received? those from Charles Verrill
      (1/18/26), Frederick Wilcox (1/20/26), and Frances Perkins (2/4/26) are especially significant.</p>

     <p>Correspondence of this period centers on the AALL's announcement (2/19/26) that its federal compensation bill for longshoremen had been introduced in the House and would be referred to as the Cummins-Graham Bill. William Green wrote (3/2/26) that the
      American Federation of Labor had informed Anthony Chlopek that all possible support would be given to this bill. Eleanor Roosevelt wrote (3/4/25) in response to an AALL form letter to the membership on this question that she was writing to the Democratic
      members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committee, urging support for the bill. Chlopek informed John Andrews (5/1/26) that his efforts on behalf of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) were much appreciated. Other areas of the
      Association's work were not forgotten. In early February Andrews traveled to Washington to lobby for the passage of the Fitzgerald Workmen's Compensation Bill and to consult with Congressman Fitzgerald. In March he reported to J. R. Haynes his meetings
      with Herbert Hoover and Scott Turner regarding his work on a mine safety bill. A New York Times editorial, dated May 8, praising the AALL's advocacy of coal dusting for coal mine safety, was the basis for yet another attempt by Andrews to raise funds for
      the Association.</p>

     <p>The progress of the Graham-Cummins bill was of continuing interest. Congressman Graham gave John Andrews his version of the reason why the bill never was called out of committee in the House, although it did pass the Senate. From August through
      December, Andrews kept up a running correspondence with Charles Verrill and Anthony Chlopek on amendments to the Graham-Cummins bill that might enable it to pass at the next session. In late November Thomas Chadbourne made an unusual pledge to the
      Association, promising to give $10,000 a year for the next three years if Andrews could raise $15,000. The money was intended especially to wipe the "black spots" off the compensation map. (The AALL Review periodically published a map showing workmen's
      compensation legislation's spread by state. Those states without any compensation law at all were shown in solid black, hence "black spots.") Andrews replied to this letter (12/2/26). Programs for 1927 included achieving workmen's compensation laws in
      those five states still without them, workmen's compensation for longshoremen (Graham-Cummins), and mine safety. John Andrews went frequently to Washington to organize support for the Graham-Cummins bill. The legislation was finally passed on March 4,
      1927. Throughout March, letters were received regretting the effect of the American Association for Old Age Security (Epstein's new organiza-tion, AAOAS) on the American Association for Labor Legislation. Most officers of the new association were AALL
      members and many felt that they had been misled by Epstein in regard to John Andrews' support for the AAOAS.</p>

     <p>Concerned over the problem of two national organizations dedicated to very similar purposes, Paul H. Douglas and Ethelbert Talbot tried to arrange a merger of the AALL and the AAOAS, After much correspondence, this effort was to result in failure.
      Andrews was very busy trying to raise funds to match the Chadbourne pledge. He also began an attack on the lack of workmen's compensation legislation in Florida with a series of letters to local politicians and local AALL members. A blow to the
      Association's mine safety campaign came when J. R. Haynes informed Andrews (8/2/27) that he would have to discontinue his financial support of the AALL in order to concentrate on a public ownership plan in Los Angeles. Andrews sought funding from the
      United Mine Workers. A letter in the fall from John L. Lewis (10/14/27) in-formed the Association that the request would go before the national executive board of the union. Work with E. A. Holbrook on mine safety standards was carried on through
      September and October.</p>

      detailed his reasons for avoiding the merger. The conflict with the Epstein organization continued to cause difficulties, as reflected in a letter from Florence Kelley (3/15/28) that charged the AALL with a lack of depth.</p>

     <p>The passage of the Fitzgerald Bill providing workmen's compensation for private employees in the District of Columbia was the highlight of the spring and summer. Merger of the AALL and the AAOAS was still advocated by Paul Douglass and by I. M. Rubinow
      and Stephen Wise, who were longtime advisers of Andrews. Before the Fitzgerald Bill was enacted, Margaret Hobbs James had succeeded to the position of AALL lobbyist. Andrews congratulated her on the bill's enactment (5/14/28) and the following day
      assigned her to work on the Jones Bill for the vocational rehabilitation of industrial cripples. The Ribnik vs. McBride decision of the Supreme Court upset the AALL's efforts to regulate private fee-charging employment agencies. There is correspondence
      with Robert Wagner which leads to his intro-duction in Congress of an AALL-drafted bill providing for public em-ployment bureaus. Andrews wrote Sophy Sanger (7/18/28) that he would be attending some of the international social workers conferences in
      Paris in July, and hoped to spend some time after that in Britain gathering material on British labor law administration. On his return in September, he wrote to Frank Hering of the Eagles, proposing that they undertake a joint study of old age pension
      systems in New York State.</p>

     <p>Workmen's compensation became an increasing concern of the Asso-ciation. John Andrews queried Felix Frankfurter and others about the possibility of compensation for railroad workers. Frankfurter's reply (10/30/28) did not favor a federal program, but
      suggested individual state legislation. Andrews was always keenly interested in national politics and supported Al Smith against Herbert Hoover. In November, after Smith's defeat, he wrote Solon De Leon that he was terribly disappointed, "Our vaunted
      religious liberty is but a bubble that has been pricked." Turning his attention to New York State, he wrote the then Governor-elect, Franklin D. Roosevelt, suggesting that he include occupational disease compensation and regulation of fee-charging
      private employment agencies in his 1929 message to the legislature. Governor Roosevelt replied that he thought the AALL's proposal of blanket coverage for occupational diseases was reasonable, and that he did not anticipate much objection to the
      proposals. Andrews wrote to Felix Frankfurter again, this time to inquire whether Frankfurter had written a minimum wage bill that would meet the constitutional objections. Frankfurter replied (12/20/28) that he felt that he and B. V. Cohen had, but that
      correspondence was too cumbersome a medium for discussion; Mr. Cohen would come to confer with Mr. Andrews. The program for 1929 was planned to include the social cost of accidents, sickness and old age insurance, unemployment, labor law administration
      and workmen's compensation for the new industrial South. A form letter (1/23/29) urged that members write in support of the vocational rehabilitation bill, the Jones Property Reserve Bill and the Wagner Bill (in earlier years known as the Kenyon-Nolan
      Bill) for adequate public employment bureaus. Margaret James Hobbs wrote (2/4/29) that she was discouraged in her work for the passage of the vocational rehabilitation bill, and expressed hope that Andrews would come to Washington to organize support for
      it.</p>

     <p>The year 1929 was dominated by the Association's attempt to institute workmen's compensation in the few southern states without it. The curtailment of contributions made the financial conditions even more critical than usual. Andrews was hard-pressed
      to match the Chadbourne pledge. The AALL's first mid-year annual meeting was organized in March. In May, and throughout the year, Andrews corresponded with John R. Commons and others concerning a very extensive study by the Association of labor law
      administration in the United States. Later that month Frances Perkins appointed Andrews to the Governor's Commission on Unemployment Problems in New York State. Andrews' attacks on a new appointee to the United States Employees Compensation Commission
      upset Fiorello La Guardia, who wrote to Andrews that the man in question "...may not have a college degree but he does have a heart." (6/11/29) The Association's relationship with the International Longshore-men's Association suffered when the new
      president, Joseph Ryan, was displeased by Andrews' actions in the union's behalf (6/20/29). Congressman G. W. Norris wrote Andrews (6/22/29) that Ryan informed him that the Longshoremen were not behind the legislation that Andrews had requested Norris to
      introduce. William Doak wrote (7/5/29) in regard to compensation for railroad workers that some of the men were too strongly opposed to it for the union to favor such legislation. The Andrews' enjoyed a long working trip across the country in the summer.
      During most of the fall, Andrews worked on unemployment prob-lems. In a December letter, John Fitch (12/6/29) reported that Labor News had suggested that the AALL be asked to draft a bill to create a federal unemployment insurance system, and that if the
      Association did not do so, a new national organization would be formed to push such legislation. In January John Andrews and AALL staff member Cornelius Cochrane traveled in the South to generate support for workmen's compensation legislation.</p>

      AALL could not get that bill passed this year, it might just as well give it up. Fred Wilcox, Chairman of the New York State Committee on Unemployment Problems, sent Andrews a copy of the committee's report (3/25/30). Financial conditions continued to
      create severe constraint on the Association's activity, and Thomas Chadbourne informed the Association (4/7/30) that he would not be able to renew his annual gift of $10,000. A mid-year meeting was held in conjunction with the National Con-ference of
      Social Work. The AALL's program included workmen's compensation, social insurance, old age pensions and unemployment remedies. April through June saw concentrated work on the unemployment relief bills that Robert Wagner had introduced. Wagner informed

      The new year brought the involvement of even more people in the Association's plans for unemployment insurance. Paul Raushenbush wrote from Wisconsin that he and Elizabeth Brandeis had ideas about the unemployment problem and wished to cooperate with the
      AALL. His letter (1/8/31) began many years of correspondence with Andrews on this subject, ending only with Andrews' death. Under discussion was the Association's "American Plan for Unemployment Insurance," a plan that featured no contribution to the
      fund on the part of the employees. William Doak, newly appointed United States Secretary of Labor, accepted the vice-presidency of the AALL on January 17, and a few weeks later (2/2/31) resigned because of the Association's advocacy of the Wagner
      employment bills.</p>

     <p>The Association's activities in the spring of 1931 were evenly distributed between unemployment relief and workmen's compensation for the southern states still without it. Activities in New York State centered on the recently formed Conference for
      Unemployment Insurance Legislation. John Fitch's letter from the conference to the parent AALL (3/10/31) lists the officers of the conference. Roosevelt wrote to Andrews (3/19/31), asking him to serve on a commission to solve the problem of inadequate
      medical aid for compensation cases. Later, Andrews wrote Roosevelt, urging that he not sign the bill authorizing private corporations to sell unemployment insurance. Andrews was in Florida in May working for workmen's compensa-tion.</p>

     <p>The familiar themes of unemployment prevention, workmen's compensation for the South and the need of the AALL for financial support recur throughout this period. A form letter sent in early June (6/4/31) indicated that at the mid-year meeting which
      would be held in Minneapolis, the chief topic was to be the prevention of unemployment. In July a telegram to the AALL office from John Andrews (7/15/31) indicated that he was working in North Carolina on workmen's compensation legislation. Later,
      Andrews wrote Ernest Draper (8/31/31) that Cochrane was still working in the South, particularly in South Carolina. The Executive Secretary's correspondence with John R. Commons (8/14/31) and a letter from Paul Raushenbush discuss the AALL's sponsorship
      of an education program in Wisconsin on unemployment insurance, financed primarily by Raushenbush and Elizabeth Brandeis. In September (9/19/31) the program, called the Wisconsin Commission for Unemployment Reserve Legislation, accelerated.</p>

     <p>Public works programs were urged simultaneously with the establishment of unemployment reserves. December 1931 and early 1932 correspondence with Arthur J. Altmeyer, Thomas Parkinson and Robert M. LaFollette Jr. included these subjects. Edwin E. Witte
      wrote John Andrews (1/16/32), giving the AALL credit for the Wisconsin unemployment insurance bill's passage and praising Andrews personally for his contribution. In February, Joseph Chamberlain and Andrews drafted legislation that would empower the
      United States Employees Compensation Commission to issue safety orders.</p>

     <p>In early March and April the Croweel vs. Benson decision evoked comments from Edwin E. Witte (3/15/32), Joseph Chamberlain (3/7/32), Arthur J. Altmeyer (3/29/32) and Walter F. Dodd (4/11/32). The fight to stem the flood of unemployment continued.
      Arthur J. Altmeyer (3/19/32) and Paul Raushenbush (3/11/32) wrote concerning unemployment insurance and reserves. The AALL backed the policy on the change in name of the New York Conference for Unemployment Insurance Legislation to the New York
      Conference for Unemployment Reserves Legislation (3/21/32). Andrews wrote Anna Bogue, secretary to Mrs. Willard Straight Elmhurst, a heavy contributor, that he was attempting to set up effective state commissions on unemployment reserve legislation in
      Michigan and Pennsylvania (4/19/32). Robert F. Wagner congratulated Andrews (4/25/32) on the favorable report that the United States House of Representatives Commerce Com-mittee gave on the unemployment exchange bill. Wagner also stated that he had
      appreciated Andrews' assistance when the fight reached the floor. Roosevelt wrote to Andrews (5/25/32), inviting him to continue to serve on a commission to study the medical and hospital problems of workmen's compensation. In August William Green wrote
      to Andrews (8/12/32), welcoming his aid in regard to unemployment insurance.</p>

     <p>During this period, Andrews and the Association were occupied primarily with unemployment relief. Andrews wrote Paul Raushenbush (10/4/32) about the amount of time the AALL had spent in working out a formula that would "save face" for gubernatorial
      candidate Lehman and reverse his position on unemployment reserves. A letter to Ernest Draper (11/10/32) deals with the National Committee on Unemployment Reserves, a satellite of the AALL. The problem of how to invest unemployment reserve monies also
      received wide attention. Mary E. Drier, Executive Secretary of the New York Conference on Unemployment Reserves Legislation, wrote to Irene Osgood Andrews (1/2/33), reminding her that when Lehman spoke on unemployment insurance, they must write and thank
      him for his leadership. In mid-January form letters were sent to all Democratic governors, calling on them to honor the Democratic platform supporting state legislation for unemployment insurance.</p>

     <p>The program for 1933 included a national system of public employment offices, federal encouragement of state unemployment reserves, and accident compensation for railroad and interstate workers. The Association was in such need of funds and office
      space that John Andrews offered (3/13/33) to sell the AALL collection of early literature on workmen's compensation to John P. Troxell at Duke University. The American Association for Old Age Pensions changed its name to the American Association for
      Social Security (AASS), also changing its focus, and arousing much comment. The AASS released its standards for unemployment insurance on July 22. Discussion on the merits of these standards continued through December in the AALL's correspondence.
      Elizabeth Brandeis, Frances Perkins, and John A. Fitch were among those who contributed their opinions.</p>

     <p>Unemployment reserves and social security were still the chief programs of the organization. Personality factors were prominent in disputes. In August Mary Drier wrote to warn Andrews (8/7/33) that they must keep Abraham Epstein out of the New York
      State fight for unemployment insurance. Dorothy Douglas resigned from the executive committee (11/4/33) because she felt its attitude toward unemployment insurance had been equivocal. Miles M. Dawson wrote Andrews (12/20/33) that he wished to cooperate
      with the AALL because he had had a falling out with Epstein. The AALL program for 1934 included sponsorship of legislation providing unemployment reserves, amendment of workmen's compensation, and public employment offices. In February Edwin E. Witte
      wrote to Andrews (2/9/34), advising him that unemployment insurance was winning support for Epstein and the AASS. Wittee felt the AALL should move quickly as "the champion of the rights of organized labor," to counter the swing.</p>

     <p>During this period the questions of state vs. national social insurance and the endorsement of unemployment reserves on insurance were vigorously debated. I. M. Rubinow wrote John Andrews (4/13/34) in regard to unemployment insurance, and also said
      that he hoped they could affect a reconciliation. Andrews discussed budget problems in his correspondence with Eustace Seligman (4/18/34), AALL treasurer. The budget had been $72,000 in 1930. By 1933, it was down to $37,000 with a deficit of about
      $1,000. The lack of funds seriously curtailed the Associations work. Isador Lubin informed Andrews (5/22/34) about the President's quandry on the Wagner-Lewis bill and the President's plan to appoint a "royal commission" to report on needed social
      legislation. Edwin E. Witte wrote Andrews (6/19/34) that he found President Roosevelt's message on social insurance too vague, and that he might discourage state legislation on this issue. To Andrews' request to be appointed to the President's commission
      for the study of social insurance, Leo Wolman replied (6/26/34) that he would do anything he could to further the appointment.</p>

     <p>The new United States Commission on Economic Security involved several active AALL members. Edwin E. Witte (8/1/34) and Arthur J. Altmeyer (8/17/34) wrote of their work and sought advice from Andrews. Frances Perkins, as chairman of the Commission,
      invited Andrews (10/30/34) to the White House Conference on Economic Security. In November (11/17/34), Andrews applied to the John and Mary Markle Foundation for a grant to cover the study of the extension of workmen's compensation to interstate commerce
      employees. A form letter sent out by the AALL (12/7/34) asked persons interested in seeing health insurance included in the new social insurance program to contact Frances Perkins immediately. Correspondence early in 1935 with the Railway Labor
      Executives Association (1/7/35), Edwin E. Witte (1/7/35) and Robert Wagner (1/11/35) concerns the bill drafted by Andrews and the AALL extending unemployment insurance to employees working in interstate commerce. Edwin E. Witte wrote (1/23/35) suggesting
      that Andrews testify for the economic security bill at the hearing.</p>

     <p>The economic security bill and workmen's compensation dominate the correspondence for this period. Edwin E. Witte thanked Andrews for his help with the economic security bill (2/23/35) but was worried that it would not be released from the House Ways
      and Means Committee. Witte asked if the AALL could stimulate some pressure. Andrews sent out an appropriate letter to the membership (2/25/35). Correspondence with members in southern states and with the general AALL membership concerning workmen's
      compensation continued. Andrews informed Paul Raushenbush (5/17/35) that Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina had all adopted workmen's compensation legislation in the first two weeks of May. The interstate commerce bill, as Andrews wrote to
      Senator Wagner (5/15/35), was in the process of being amended by an AALL committee. A long letter (8/11/35) gave Andrews Edwin E. Witte's reactions to the final passage of the Social Security Act, his own feelings toward it, toward Andrews and toward the
      work done by the AALL.</p>

     <p>The launching of Social Security provoked much discussion. Edwin E. Witte reported (11/5/35) and Andrews "will certainly be considered," according to Altmeyer and Winant, for the Geneva appointment. (This probably refers to the position of American
      representative to the International Labor Office). Frances Perkins wrote to Andrews (1/3/36) to comment on his latest book, Administration of Labor Legislation. Edwin E. Witte wrote (1/25/36) that he felt that Abraham Epstein was trying to get credit for
      himself for the passage of the Social Security Sill and deny credit to President Roosevelt. The new year brought renewed interest in industrial safety. Walter Gellhorn, Frances Perkins, and several others corresponded with Andrews in February about
      problems concerning occupational disease, particularly silicosis and tuberculosis.</p>

      back to England to complete his study of British factory inspection and labor law administration. When Andrews returned to New York, he reported to Edwin E. Witte (8/25/36) on the Geneva conference and the possibility of his spending another three months
      there in the fall. Andrews had been named a special agent to the United States Department of Labor and was asked to write a report on the results of his British factory inspection study. Andrews wrote Elizabeth Brandeis (10/5/36) that things were so
      difficult financially for the AALL that neither he nor Irene had drawn a salary for the last six months. Frances Perkins suggested to Andrews (11/24/36) that his proposed study of financing labor law administration be made under the sponsorship of the

      Brainard that he would be attending the ILO conference and working at the ILO office in Geneva during June and July. On his return to the United States, he continued to work to raise mine safety standards. A letter from D. Harrington, Chief of the Health

      The budget reached a new low of $25,000. Andrews suggested (1/29/38) to the treasurer, Eustace Seligman, that a special effort be made to secure funds for mine safety, physical examinations for workers, and the ratification of the ILO maritime
      conventions. John Andrews sent John Winant at the ILO, Geneva (5/6/38), parts of the report on labor inspection in the United States. Andrews returned to Geneva that summer. Andrews and Walter Gellhorn corresponded through October and December on the
      "...baby Wagner Act" and the Walsh-Healy Bill that the AALL was setting up for the Rhode Island Federation of Labor. Andrews sent the Walsh-Healy Bill to the Rhode Island Federation of Labor (12/22/38). During the first three months of 1939, amendments
      to the interstate workmen's compensation bill were prepared. Andrews sent Robert Wagner (1/22/39) amendments to the interstate workmen's bill which he hoped Wagner would approve and reintroduce. Frances Perkins replied (1/27/39) to Andrews' note in
      regard to the Harry Bridges case: "It helps a great deal to hear from one's . . ." John A. Kratz (2/24/39) gave Andrews credit for the original passage of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act and thanked Andrews for his suggestions. Andrews also wrote to

      that Arthur J. Altmeyer forced Witte to make in an article. Andrews thought the changes were ridiculous. John L. Lewis complimented Andrews (2/10/40) on the letter the AALL distributed on the need for mine safety legislation, and asked Andrews to remove
      his name from the Association letterhead, as his policy did not permit his name to be used. The Director of the Department of Engineering of the United Mine Workers, Walter Polakov, also wrote, agreeing to cooperate with the AALL on improving mine safety

      departments of labor, asking about the failure of employers to insure their employees. In April, Andrews wrote to Merritt L. Gordon (4/14/41), relating the early years of the AALL. Andrews stated that he had attended the first organizational meeting in

      legislation." Plans for the annual meeting were discussed with Professor C. Clively in October (10/8/42), which suggested a joint meeting with the Rural Sociological Society on Mexican workers in the United States and the general need for extending
      social security protection to farm workers. One of Andrews' last letters in the collection, written shortly before his death, is to Barbara Peterson of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, explaining that for the first time the AALL's annual meeting
