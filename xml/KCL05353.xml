            <p>This case resulted in New York State's 1933 minimum wage law for women and children
                being declared unconstitutional. Both New York State's Court of Appeals and the
                United States Supreme Court found that a state may not regulate the wages of adult
                women, because to do so would interfere with their freedom to contract, guaranteed
                to them by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution. </p>
            <p>The case began when Joseph Tipaldo, manager of the Spotlight Laundry of Brooklyn, was
                indicted by a Kings County Grand Jury on November 2, 1934, and charged with
                "altering books and records for the purpose of concealing the failure to pay female
                employees the minimum fair wage prescribed in a mandatory order of the Industrial
                Commissioner of New York State." Tipaldo claimed the minimum wage law operated to
                deprive him of his liberty and property without due process of law and compelled him
                to be a witness against himself in a criminal case. The law required him to keep a
                record of the wages paid to and hours worked by his women employees. Tipaldo sued
                for a writ of habeas corpus in April, 1935. The writ was denied by Justice May of
                New York's Supreme Court who found the 1933 minimum wage law to be constitutional.
                Tipaldo appealed to the Court of Appeals and this decision was reversed. The United
                States Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals decision.</p>
