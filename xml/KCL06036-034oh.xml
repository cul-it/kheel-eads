   <p>Founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing about 2,000 members in cities in the
    northeastern United States, the ILGWU grew in geographical scope, membership size, political
    influence to become one of the most powerful forces in American organized labor by mid-century.
    Representing workers in the women's garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and
    living conditions of its members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs,
    health care facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. In
    1995, the ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) to form
    the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE).</p>

   <p>Mabel Durham Fuller was born on April 1, 1905 in Kingston, New York, where she attended the
    local public schools of Kingston and Yonkers. She was an operator in an undergarment factory
    before the shop was unionized, and after it was organized, Fuller became the shop chairlady. She
    was a member of the Undergarment and Negligee Workers Union, Local 62 and elected to the
    Executive Board in 1937. As a member of the Board, Fuller served on the Finance Committee and
    Sick Benefit Committee. She was also elected as a delegate to attend several ILGWU National
    Conventions. Fuller attended the Hudson Shore Labor School, as well as the U.S. Army
    Administration school from 1944-1945, and was the first woman to attend the Harvard Trade Union
    Institute where she was a fellow from 1945-1946. Fuller became the first African American staff
    member of the Education Department in 1946. In the Education Department, Fuller helped to plan
    and direct programs that aimed at improving the image of the union not only to the members, but
    also to the public. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Fuller was an American National Red Cross instructor, chair of the Women's Service Brigade
    during World War II, delegate to the Negro Labor Committee, member of the Committee for Civil
    Rights, the Urban League, the NAACP, and the Liberal Party.</p>

    York, an integrated town which no longer exists and where Fuller spent her early years. In the
    second cassette tape, Fuller provides an overview of her work history, including her first job,
    the general strike of 1933, and working in the Education Department of Local 62.</p>
