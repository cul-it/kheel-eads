            <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
                unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
                about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
                first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played a
                key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally
                referred to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope,
                membership size, and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces
                in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's
                garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its
                members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care
                facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The
                ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form
                the Union of Needle trades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged
                with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a
                new union known as UNITE HERE. The two unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented
                only 250,000 workers between them, down from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000
                in 1969.</p>

            <p>Myrtle Banks was born in North Little Rock, Arkansas in 1919, and in 1946, began work
                in California's garment industry, and became a member of in the Dressmakers' Union
                Local 101 in San Francisco. In 1961, after fifteen years working as a garment worker
                and, for a time, serving as shop steward at Koret of California in San Francisco,
                Myrtle Banks became a business agent with the ILGWU. In 1984, Banks retired from her
                position as business representative in the Pacific Northwest District Council.
                Throughout her career, she served as Chair of the Alameda County Chapter of the A.
                Philip Randolph Institute, Vice President of the Alameda County Civil Service
                Commission, and Trustee of the San Francisco Joint Board.</p>
