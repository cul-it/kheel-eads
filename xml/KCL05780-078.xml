            <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was once one of the largest labor
                unions in the United States founded in 1900 by local union delegates representing
                about 2,000 members in cities in the northeastern United States. It was one of the
                first U.S. Unions to have a membership consisting of mostly females, and it played a
                key role in the labor history of the 1920s and 1930s. The union is generally
                referred to as the "ILGWU" or the "ILG". The ILGWU grew in geographical scope,
                membership size, and political influence to become one of the most powerful forces
                in American organized labor by mid-century. Representing workers in the women's
                garment industry, the ILGWU worked to improve working and living conditions of its
                members through collective bargaining agreements, training programs, health care
                facilities, cooperative housing, educational opportunities, and other efforts. The
                ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form
                the Union of Needle trades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE). UNITE merged
                with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) in 2004 to create a
                new union known as UNITE HERE. The two unions that formed UNITE in 1995 represented
                only 250,000 workers between them, down from the ILGWU's peak membership of 450,000
                in 1969.</p>

        <bioghist encodinganalog="MARC 545">
            
            <p>Formed in 1937, the Research Department of the International Ladies' Garment Workers'
                Union (ILGWU) supported the administrative operations of the Union and coordinated
                the ILGWU's investigative operations. It provided union leaders with information on
                wages, working conditions, economic conditions, and other matters in the women's
                garment industry; analyzed information for the union; and monitored developments in
                the industry. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>In addition to providing research for union leadership, Research Department staff
                prepared materials for Congressional testimony, presented cases on behalf of local
                unions to the War Labor Board, and worked to administer the Fair Labor Standards
                Act. At times, the director of the Research Department represented the ILGWU in
                national forums. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The Department also maintained an extensive library, collecting and housing documents
                from Union administrative staff that were deemed substantive and of lasting value to
                the Union, whether produced internally or externally. The information gathered by
                the Department was of particular value during labor disputes and contract
                negotiations. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Lazare Teper was the founding director of the ILGWU's Research Department, working in
                that position from 1937 to 1980. Born in Russia sometime between 1906 and 1908,
                Teper later studied at the University of Paris and earned his doctorate at Johns
                Hopkins University. He died in New York City in 1985.</p>

            <p>The Research Department records reflect the department's varied functions,
                documenting its role in gathering and analyzing information for international and
                local union leadership, representing the union before government and labor
                organizations, and gathering materials of research, and oftentimes historical,
                value. Some segments of the records focus on one aspect of the department's work,
                and others include documentation across the department's functions. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Research Department director Lazare Teper's papers, for example, include files
                relating to the Wage Stabilization Board (5780/105). The department also maintained
                records focused on the National Coat and Suit Industry Board (statements of receipts
                and disbursements, label division reports, meetings minutes, bulletins to members,
                and other reports and resolutions), as well as some related legal files (5780/123).
                Also among the documents collected by the Research Department are the New York Coat
                and Suit Industry Reports between 1934 and 1960. (5780/168) </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Parts of the Research Department records consist primarily of collected documents
                from ILGWU affiliates. In this way, they resemble and, in some instances, complement
                the parts of the Archives Department Records (5780/121, 5780/121 PUBS), records
                generated by local unions (Series III), and the general collection of ILGWU
                publications (5780 PUBS). Research Department records of this kind contain records
                of predecessor unions to the ILGWU and ILGWU local union records (5780/045), or the
                annual report, "Conditions in the Women's Clothing Industry" (5780/078). </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Other parts of the Research Department records document all of the department's
                functions. These records include financial and administrative reports, meeting
                minutes, and correspondence (5780/056, 5780/209), collected printed material
                (5780/168), and ILGWU statements on issues related to the garment industry
                (5780/209). </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The Research Department reports primarily consists of reports from the Research
                Department, including its annual "Conditions in the Women's Clothing Industry."</p>
