						<p>Image depicts a male employee at a Saueressig machine, probably in the Cranston, R.I., plant of the Cranston Print Works. A Saueressig machine (manufactured by the Saueressig company in Germany) strikes off sample prints, giving the

					<scopecontent>
						<p>Image depicts a male employee at a rotary screen printing machine, probably in the Cranston, R.I., plant of the Cranston Print Works. Note the printed fabric coming off the roll. In contrast to roller printing, rotary screen printing
							requires very little pressure; the colors remain more on the surface and produce a brighter appearance. The Sprague family originally owned the Sprague Print Works, which passed to B.B. &amp; R. Knight after the Civil War, and
							was reorganized as the Cranston Print Works in 1920. The original of this photo was probably taken in conjunction with the 150th anniversary of the Cranston Print Works. A detail of this photo is found in "Cranston: a designing

						<p>Image depicts two male employees at a turbo steamer, used for the ageing of fabrics, probably in the Cranston, R.I., plant of the Cranston Print Works. To make the design on the cloth color-fast, the cloth is aged by neutral or acid
							steaming or "cured" by dry heat to develop and fix the colors. The Sprague family originally owned the Sprague Print Works, which passed to B.B. &amp; R. Knight after the Civil War, and was reorganized as the Cranston Print
